(Phone Ringing)
Hello?
Why don't you just tell  me what's happened?
And what is it?
I'll be right down.
What's happened?
"Oh, Susannah."
Susannah?
Princess Susannah.
Is she all right?
I don't know.
(wailing)
(Princess Susannah)  Don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
(man)  Read the statement.
Yes. All right.
On this screen?
(man) That is correct.
"I am Susannah,  Duchess of Beaumont."
Popularly known as  Princess Susannah.
"I am in a place  you cannot find,"
held by one you will not trace.
"Prime Minister  Michael Callow,"
"Prime Minister Michael  Callow, my...my life..."
my life depends on you.
If you do not do  precisely as instructed...
"...by four pm this  afternoon, I will be......"
...I will be executed.
What are you doing?  Keep it going.
"Prime Minister,  at this point I think it's"
important to say that we  are 100% certain that this
is indeed Princess Susannah.
Her car was intercepted
"shortly after midnight,  returning from the wedding"
of a college  friend of hers.
She'd insisted  on going.
But you had  security on her?
"Two PPOs,  still unconscious,"
"heavy sedative, close range,  each with a single puncture  wound,"
no sign of struggle.
What do they want?
Money?
Release of Jihadi?
Scrap Third World debt?
Save the fucking libraries?
We are convinced  both the video and the
demand it contains are genuine.
What demand?
What Susannah says next.
"It concerns  you directly, sir."
Just play it.
"(Princess Susannah)  There is only one demand,"
and it is a simple one.
"At four pm this afternoon,  Prime Minister Michael Callow"
must appear on live  British television
"on all networks,  terrestrial and satellite,"
and...no...
(sobbing)
"... on all British networks,  terrestrial and satellite,"
and have full unsimulated  sexual intercourse with a pig.
I don't understand!
(Julian) The video ends  with a series of technical
specifications  for the broadcast.
Why are you doing this?
This is a joke? Right?
"Ha-ha, Mike. Ho-ho."
It's real.
She said pig.
Sex with a pig.
They want me to  have sex with a pig.
"Live, on television  this afternoon."
But what...
Who?
"We're checking with  our embedded operatives,"
compiling a list  of suspects as we speak.
"Meanwhile, the  demand has been made,"
and there's not long to  formulate our response.
"Well, I'm not fucking a pig."
"Page one,  that's not happening."
Of course.
"Absolutely, sir."
"Well, have we established  a dialogue with this..."
"We can't, there's  no e-mail address,"
"no codeword, no  channels for negotiation."
"Okay, so we'll focus  on finding Susannah."
Hmm? We get her back.
"And however it's done,  I don't care."
We stop this now.
"I assure you, everyone's  working towards this."
"Yes...no, not everyone,  a dedicated core team,"
"this can't go wide,"
and keep it so far  from the press
it's on the other  side of Jupiter.
This only  exists in this room.
It's already outside it.
"Well if there are hacks  sniffing around,  shut them down."
Bright red D notice.
Super fucking Godzilla  injunction
with ten-inch  Whitehall fangs.
This video came from YouTube.
What?
It was uploaded via an encrypted  IP over an hour ago.
Well get it off there!
"We did, after nine  minutes,"
"but that was long enough  for it to be downloaded,"
duplicated and spread.
Spread?
How many people  have seen this?
"We take down one, six clones  immediately pop up elsewhere."
How many people?
"50,000, that's  our current estimate."
The news rooms  have got it.
They're running  this on air?
"No, no, we put a type  5D notice out immediately."
And they're complying.
"For now, it's  trending on Twitter."
Oh for...  fucking Internet.
So what now?  What's the play book?
"This is virgin territory,  Prime Minister."
There's no play book.
(woman) Princess Susannah's  been kidnapped.
You scared the  shit out of me.
And there's a  YouTube of it...
"Oh, go to work."
(Princess Susannah)  ...and have full unsimulated
sexual intercourse  with a pig...
"No way. It's a piss take,  man, look at it!"
I don't understand!
Why's it not on the news.
(woman) ...Carlton Bloom's  controversial agitation
exhibition at the Tate Modern  closes three weeks ahead of
schedule amid criticism...
"So how do we even describe it?  ""An indecent act."""
Everyone's seen the video.
They already know  the full details.
"If we mention  bestiality pre-watershed,"
Ofcom would be  seriously pissed off.
Fuck Ofcom.
We're still  observing the D notice.
But surely we're  going to do something...
We're honouring  the D notice.
The voluntary D notice.
"It may be a sportsman-like  gesture,"
"but we are making it,"
"a woman's life is at stake here,  we follow procedure."
My time line consists  100 per cent of viewers asking
why we're not  covering it.
How do I reply?
You don't.
That is  totally backwards.
"No-one else has broken rank,  not the Beeb, not Sky, not..."
I hear Facebook's coverage  is pretty comprehensive.
"(Laughter)  That may be, but..."
(woman) It's like  9/11's happening
and we're broadcasting  sandwich recipes.
Martin We're not a chat room.
It's on CNN. And Fox.
"And MSNBC, Al Jazeera, NHK..."
"Yeah, all right."
"Oh, God, this planet."
"Okay, Sarah, cover the snatch  itself, Damon public reaction,"
"Mira, the royal angle, upcoming  marriage etc."
"Simon, set tone with standards  and practices."
we need to explain  this without viewers
sicking up  their Weetabix.
"Lorcan, the Internet aspect, new  paradigm, Twitter, Arab spring,"
all that bibble.
"Dan, all graphics run past me,  keep it functional,"
no pepper pigs.
"Malaika, update the  Princess obit VT."
The obit VT?
"Hm, first an awkward phone call,  the least I can do is warn Tom."
We put a D notice on it.
"(Martin) It's gone global, Tom."
Don't.
(Martin) I can't do anything...
- I'm begging you.  - You're begging me?
"Don't run it, Martin."
"Look I'm sorry,  I can't help you."
You know how much help  you're getting from here on in?
"Multiplying nothing by shit  all, UKN is dead to us."
"Shove it up your ass,  you fucking..."
Interesting?
A man.
A man?
A man.
"Tom. So you're  across it,"
I'm exploring contingency plans.
I briefed Callett.
"Ah, Mr Callett,  Noel from Blue Eye."
Noel won an Emmy  for his effects work
on that HBO moon  Western thing.
Sea of Tranquillity.
"Yeah, yeah, you  won't find better."
"Can you map a head  onto a different body, live?"
It depends if  your camera's moving.
Rule sheet specifies  a single hand held camera
in a constant roving motion.
"Hm, yeah, Gonzo style,  he knows his shit."
That's tough.
"""Fruition to be transmitted  in four."" What does..."
"Just focus on the visuals,"
different face mapped  onto a live performer.
According to  those stipulations.
Fringe is a possibility...
"Deadline's at four, we need  to know if it's workable by two."
Can't happen.
It has to.
Our Embeds have ruled  out the major players.
"It's not AQ, not IRA, this  is what's left,"
"radicals, hate groups,"
people who threaten yourself  or the royals.
They're being pulled in  even as we speak.
And more than  questioning I hope.
Somebody knows something.
(news reader) If we all  do it more
then there'll be less waste  overall
lying around whenever  the bin men...
Is it still  not on the telly?
"Nothing,  must be a hoax."
Or a black-out.
Oh! Heads up.
"Some major breaking  news here now on UKN,"
in the last few minutes
"it's been confirmed that  Susannah, Duchess of Beaumont,"
has been kidnapped.
A video uploaded anonymously
"to the Internet, appears  to depict the princess"
pleading for her life.
The video also contains  a bizarre ransom demand
of a personal nature  involving the Prime Minister.
This is followed by a  detailed list of instructions
relating to the  enactment of this demand.
As police round up  potential suspects...
Good morning.
...this UKN news viewer video  shows armed officers
"raiding an address in Bradford,"
a man thought to be connected  with a religious pressure group
can be seen being  dragged to a waiting van.
Details regarding the...
"If it's terrorists,  they'll take her head off."
"Fuck's sake, man."
Just saying.
They'll be asking for  a million quid or something.
They want him to do it  with a pig.
Telegraph has the whole video
"and an interactive time line,  Tonilee Stark,"
"brief mention of  the ransom being a sex act,"
nothing too gross.
"The Sun runs with ""Taken,  Big Brother Susannah"" the..."
Of course I still want  that drink.
(Malaika) Well then  give me something.
It's not...  that won't be possible.
"I'm friendly when I drink, very  friendly when I'm grateful."
There's no comment at this time.
(disconnects)
(photo click)
"The Guardian are running  a fucking live blog,"
and a short think piece on the  historical symbolism of the pig.
(phone beep)
"(Newsreader) ...4pm deadline  now only five hours away,"
UKN's Damon Brown analyses the  public reaction to the crisis.
(Damon) It's a day  like no other.
The kidnapped video has now  been watched
by over 18 million  people.
The social networking sites  are abuzz
"with an estimated  10,000 tweets per minute."
So while we wait  for Downing Street
"to make a formal response,"
there's no doubt that the  nation is voicing its opinion.
I don't think  anyone should concede to
any sort of humiliation  under that kind of threat.
I couldn't bare to  see that and watch that.
"I won't personally be  tuning in,"
"I mean just thinking  about it, it's horrible."
"(woman) That's disgusting,"
it is disgusting  if you think about it.
"(man) It's going to be  disgusting,"
"but after that,  he's going to be a hero."
(woman) People abroad  will look at him
"like he is totally insane, and  maybe take his position away."
(woman) It would be absolutely  hilarious to see that on TV.
"(man) Nothing too abnormal  for Prime Ministers and MPs,"
"they're all deviant,  sexual deviants,"
all MPs and  Prime Ministers.
"We've been squeezing hard,  but still nothing concrete."
"It is my house,  you cannot stop me"
while you're standing  in my doorway.
You are touching my  door handle.
Can I have a word?
It won't come to that.
And if they don't find her?
Mi5 have got a name. They're  surrounding the place now.
Where?
What?
Where's the place?
- Truro.  - Why are you lying?
What?
You're lying.  Truro? Jesus.
I don't want  you worrying.
"You never patronise  me, don't start now."
"Whoever this is,  is insane."
And has a Princess.
Who'll get through this.
"Not just any princess,  The Princess, Princess bloody"
"Facebook, bloody eco-conscious,  national sweetheart."
I won't have  to do anything.
Everyone's  laughing at us.
You don't know that.
I know people.
"We love humiliation,  we can't not laugh."
Nothing is  going to happen.
It's already  happening in their heads.
"In their heads,  that's what you're doing,"
what my husband is doing.
Just...
Please?
Jane.
I love you.
(Knock At Door)
What?
"The palace on the phone, sir."
Get Alex to stall  them for a minute.
She's already been speaking  to her for ten minutes.
Her?
It's the queen herself.
Go on.
As the four pm deadline draws  nearer and the world holds
its breath waiting to discover  whether Princess Susannah...
Would they  use a female pig?
It's on the list.
"They list the rules  at the end of the video,"
it specifies camera  angles and things.
Like Dogme 95.
It's not like Dogme 95.
Exactly like it.
What's Dogme 95?
Cinematic movement.
Lars Von Trier.
Oh.
"List of rules for the  director, no background music,"
only natural light and so on.  For authenticity.
"Same as these rules, so  they can't cheat it,"
intercut another guy's  arse pumping away.
I mean I can't think  of anything remotely like this.
"it's an entirely new  form of terrorism,"
the point of which...
"If it's terrorism,  it's not Islamist in nature"
to request a pig.  It's specifically abhorrent...
"Well that's exactly the  point, to make love to a pig."
Make love?
Steer them away from  the grisly details.
But we can't  discount anything...
Let's not dwell on  any of the details.
this is already a huge national  talking point.
isn't this precisely what  whoever is behind this
is looking for?
(Alex) How's her  majesty taking it?
I trust you'll do everything  in your power to get her back.
That's what she said.
And we are.
"It wasn't a collective you,  it was a singular you, i.e. me."
"Sir, we may have something."
Jamie's been  tracing the video's origin.
I thought it was untraceable.
"Technically yes,  but so I thought,"
"work with what we  do know, and that video?"
"Okay, before YouTube  compression it was 57.3 meg..."
"...algorithm, boring."
"Anyway, we also know  it was uploaded at 3:16am,"
so I ran a nationwide  trace back on uninterrupted
one way uploads at precisely  57.3 meg in the minutes
"leading up to 3:16,"
and the closest I can get  is a post code.
But it came  from somewhere in there.
Looks like a campus.
"(Jamie) Yep, closed 2010  and it's been empty since."
And the latest i-sat  on this image on this area?
(Jamie) Three am flyover  shot from last night.
Looks like  it had lights on.
We've got him.
We've got him.
"Alert the local  team, we'll head out now,"
"full squad, I'll man it."
With helmet cam relay.  We can watch the operation.
"Press office, okay Tom?"
Yes!
"Right, confident?"
It's a bit of a kick  bollocks scramble
"but with finessing,  it should be okay."
"Well, finesse quickly,  our performer's on his way."
"It's a new one for me,  obviously, because it's illegal."
"I wouldn't  normally, you know."
Have you seen any of my films?
No.
"Well I'm pretty trad, bish,  bash, bosh, in and out."
"Yep, well what'd I put  on the invoice?"
That's what I'm wondering?
There won't be  any invoicing.
"Oi, oi, Rod."
"Oi, oi. Saveloy...  all right..."
"You need to prep two statements  on the rescue operation,"
"good outcome,  bad outcome."
The rescue operation?
The goon squad's heading  for some postcode
in Buckinghamshire.
"HP8 4TD,  it's a college or something."
They should be there by now.
(keypad beeping)
(cell beep)
"(zipper,  camera click)"
(cell beep)
"Yeah, reduce the luminance  of the chroma key..."
"Agent Callett,  this is Mr. Flynn."
Aka Rod Senseless.
Stage name.
"Yeah, well."
You need to get into this.
Is there a dressing  room I can use?
No.
Where's my co-star?
It'd be rude not to give her  a bit of a kiss beforehand.
"Outside, in the truck."
"Full of joie de vivre,  isn't he?"
You also need to wear this.
On your head.
"(Walker) Board's been prized  away, that's where they got in."
Okay.
Target identified.
- Commissioner.  - Thank you.
"Saw Team Red, it's probably  a possible entry point."
"Any orders, boss?"
Continue reconnaissance  and await instructions  before you proceed.
"(newsreader) With the 4pm  deadline only three hours away,"
time is running out  for the prime minister.
So how did the kidnapper  get close to the princess
who was making an unscheduled  visit to her friend's wedding?
Have they gone in yet?
Do you think  I'd be here if they had?
I've got statements  for either outcome.
"Listen, the coverage  is very sympathetic."
I can't think  about coverage now.
"No, of course."
But it's onside?
Strong undercurrent of sympathy.
Every poll indicates   public understanding.
"disgust with the captor,"
"outraged at the whole  thing, but not at you."
"The fact is,  if Walker's team fuck up,"
"I'm not saying they will,  but if they do,"
the public anticipates  non-compliance.
"There'll be squawks  from the usuals,"
but it's not England expects.
"If he kills her, there's  no blood on your hands."
Bottom line.
"With just hours to go  before the deadline,"
time is running out  for the security services.
"Joining us is actress  Lydia Galway, who attended..."
(Martin) Thought this story  was coming from IB7.
"(woman) It is, but we trimmed  the edit so it's coming direct."
Where do I know  Twinkle Toes from?
"Actress, Downton Abbey,  knows the princess."
"This came for you,  left at reception."
"Thanks, Jack."
Courier dropped it off.
"(woman) 20 seconds  on the end, thanks."
Plug this in.
"- Oh, Jesus!  - (gasps all around)"
Shit.
Jesus.
"Jack, call the police."
- (Jack) What me?  - (Martin) Please take it.
(woman) Get someone  to shoot that first.
(Martin) What the fuck is this?
"(woman) ""I gave you rules,  I said no cheating."""
(Susanna screams)
"(Martin) Ooh, urgh."
"Some more breaking news  now, and a severed finger"
"thought to belong to  Princess Susannah,"
"has been delivered to UKN,"
"along with a video, apparently   showing the kidnapper"
removing it from the Princess.
UKN News has passed all  material to Scotland Yard.
Fucking hell.
"Oh, God, I can't watch this."
He's got to do what they want.
"Yes, he fucking has."
(newsreader) ...accompanied by  a memory stick which contained
a statement accusing Downing  Street of attempting to break
rules laid down in  the demands.
"Well, this grim development"
comes just hours before the  4pm deadline out...
(mutes TV)
Jesus.
"Unless I'm mistaken,"
our mystery man specified no  visual trickery
in his original demand  didn't he?
I considered it nec...
Considered it necessary.
- ...to devise...  - Fucking hell!
Oi!
- Mike?  - Don't.
It's nor...
One word and I swear I  will fucking...I'll get...
"What did you do, Alex?"
I had a back up plan.
"Man prepared to do it,  and an FX company"
that'd paint your head  onto his shoulders.
And you actually  thought that would work?
I believed it worth considering.
Then you're a stupid bitch.
With your interests at heart.
Who knew about this?
"A select few, it seems some  idiot at the studios"
"recognised our designated  performer, tweeted a photo,"
and the online hive mind  did the maths.
It's not playing well.
With who?
With er...with anyone.
"(man) A few hours ago,"
public opinion was behind  Prime Minister Callow
with only 28 percent  of the public believing
he should fulfil the  bizarre and illegal request.
But in the wake of these images
"and with the delivery of the  Princess's severed finger  to UKN,"
the mood is shifting.
"(woman) It'll be humiliating,"
but nothing compared  to her suffering.
"(man) With the appearance  of the finger,"
he's just got to do it.
"(man 2) He has to do it,  what's the alternative?"
"(man 3) We can easily  get another Prime Minister,"
but we can't live  without a princess.
Of course he  should do it.
"Well, if he doesn't  get her released,"
"you know, he's finished  isn't he?"
(reporter) Online polls  suggest that 86 percent
of voters now believe  the demand should be met.
"Damon Brown, UK."
When are Walker's team  hitting the college.
They need time to assess...
"It's almost half two,  no more pissing around."
Julia's advising against it.
"And I'm advising  for, they go in now."
They go in now.
None
(dials phone)
(phone rings)
Where's my obit VT?
What would you say if I told  you I was standing near the
building where  Susannah's being held.
I'd say bullshit.
Then you'd be wrong.
Have you got  a crew with you?
"No, I'm not stupid."
Malaika? Hello?
None
(Malaika) Are you getting this?
"Yeah, we are."
"Stay back, don't put  yourself in any danger."
(Malaika) Still getting this?
"Yeah, yeah, we are, just  stay safe Malaika, be careful."
If this doesn't work...
We need to...
God.
(Shouting)
(Soldier)  Lie down on the floor.
None
Go!
Stand where you are!
Fuck.
"It's a decoy, they must have  bounced the upload from here"
with the proxy. They could  be anywhere. I'm sorry.
"(Martin) Oh, Jesus."
They're  looking right at her.
"No, they can't see her,  there's this screen here."
"(woman) Malaika,  make sure they can't..."
Lay down!  (Shouting)
"Run, Malaika, run!"
"(Martin) Get out  of there, come on!"
(soldier) Stay where you are!
(shouting)
(Gunfire)
Is it him?  Have we got him?
Jack!  Where the fuck is Jack?
(Malaika groaning)
"(Soldier) Down, down."
"UKN, that's Malaika something  or other, she's from UKN."
- You're press?  - Yes.
(gun shot)
Ah...ah...
There goes your RTS award.
There must be something.
"There's nothing there, Mike."
"There'll be a clue,  some evidence."
We've done all we can.
You sent in a strike  team to rescue a manikin.
"I'm sorry, Michael."
"Oh, fuck off, Julian."
"Michael, it's twenty past  three, we're out of time."
We're not out of time.
We're not out of time.
Oh...
It's not going to happen.
To the public...
Fuck the public.
"To the public this would  be one man of, to be blunt,"
"questionable popularity,  putting personal embarrassment"
over the life of a young girl.
"He won't even  release her anyway,"
she's probably already dead.
And if she isn't he'll kill  her and upload the video.
Everyone will see it.  The world will see it.
"The mood will border on  insurrection,"
"and you will be destroyed,  I guarantee you."
Utterly destroyed.
The polling  bears that out.
"You won't just be a  disgraced politician,"
you'll be a despised individual.
"The public, the Palace, and the  party insist on compliance."
Fuck the party.
"Refuse, and I've been  advised that we cannot"
guarantee your physical safety.
Or that of your family.
But...
I've made arrangements  for the broadcast.
I can't.
"I'm sorry Michael,  it's out of your hands."
Let's take you live now to  the scene in Central London.
"As we see, the Prime Minister's  car travelling across London..."
He's going to do it.
The world's bloody broken.
...now appears to be heading  west to Bankside Studios.

"(Alex)  We've ratified the law,"
after midnight it'll be a  criminal offence
to store any recording  or still images of the event.
They're doing an announcement  beforehand
"to warn people off  even watching,"
some sort of sonic tone  that causes nausea.
"(newsreader) Of course, this  comes at a time when opinion"
has very much hardened...
"(newsreader) As the 4pm  deadline approaches,"
the whole nation is at a  standstill
watching this extraordinary  situation play out.
"And just to remind you,"
this is now a story  of global significance.
"(Tom) ""Michael Callow has  displayed incredible bravery"
"in what was literally a matter  of life or death."""
"That's how it opens,"
"and then I think we  should move onto...okay, yep."
(Alex) Everything prepared?
"(Mr Callett) Yes, ma'am."
"- It's sedated?  - Injection, it's docile."
(Alex) It's time to go in now.
...an unprecedented nature.
(announcer) This is an  official announcement.
"In a few minutes,  the Prime Minister"
will perform an indecent  act on your screens.
(cheers)
This is in accordance with the  kidnapper's demand in the hope
that it will ensure the safe  release of Princess Susannah.
Recording or possessing  a copy of this broadcast
will become illegal  at midnight.
All viewers are advised
to turn off their  televisions immediately.
The broadcast will commence  after the following tone.
(High Pitched Tone)
"We're complying with  all the stipulated rules,"
so you'll have  to keep going.
You'll have to see it  through to the end.
We've placed visual aids in your  eye line
which might help if you...  get into trouble.
A suggestion we're getting  from psychologists is
that you should take  as long as you need.
To rush might be misinterpreted  as eagerness or even enjoyment.
It's just a skeleton  crew inside.
Closed set.
(Pig Snorting)
(Man) He might do it anyway!  There he is...
(cheers)
I trust this will bring  about the safe return
of Princess Susannah.
I...
I love my wife.
Aah.
May God forgive me.
(laughing)
(Man) Urgh.
None
(no audible dialogue)
Jesus.
Poor bastard.
No.
But it's been on  for nearly an hour.
"It's history, this."
(vomiting)
(phone rings)
"(Walker) She's back, ma'am.  We've got her, Susannah."
They released her?
"Yeah, stumbling about in the  middle of the city, sedated,"
"she can't remember anything,  but she's unharmed."
But her finger?
"Not hers, the  DNA shows it's male."
What?
"There is one other thing  ma'am, there's a CCTV grab"
"of her from half three,  it seems he let her go"
30 minutes before it happened.
Why?
"My guess, he  knew everyone would be"
"elsewhere, watching screens."
So it's a statement.
Ma'am?
"That's what this was all  about, about making a point."
Should we...
Lose that page of the report.
"No-one sees it,  especially the PM."
Of course.
"Good news, Michael,  you saved her."
Susanne is alive and well.

"On the one year anniversary  of his humiliating ordeal,"
an apparently unconcerned  Michael Callow
put in an assured performance  at a public appearance today
accompanied by his wife Jane.
Here I go! Okay.
Oh! Aah!
The other central figure  in last year's events was also
before the camera
at last night's  Children Of Valour awards.
Princess Susannah made  her first public appearance
since announcing her pregnancy.
It was one year ago today
that the former Turner Prize-  winning artist
Carlton Bloom coerced  the Prime Minister
into committing an indecent act  with the audacious kidnapping.
As the anniversary arrived  one art critic has caused
controversy by describing  it as the first great artwork
of the 21st century.
"but while cultural commentators  debate its significance,"
there's no denying  that with a global audience
"of 1.3 billion,"
it was an event  in which we all participated.
"However, the incident  failed to destroy"

three points higher than  this time last year.

(Selma Telse) The best  thing about my new lifestyle?
Where do I start?
"I love choosing my  clothes, and I love gold."
I feel like it really  expresses who I really am.
And I love looking  over outside.
It's so beautiful sometimes
I just wish that everyone  could see it.
"Ooh, nice outfit!  Suits ya!"

Ruthless honesty.

Short for Abi Khan.
You're a new person.  I've not seen you.
I just went 21 last week.
I wanted to go to air down.
My sister's there but ...  it was full apparently.
Proper fruit.  It was worth the revs.
The most natural thing  in there's probably
grown in a Petri dish.
Yeah. Worth it though.
"Yeah, that's the  right way around."
"When you get the  cheap, lardy gunk,"
you end up having  to pedal it off.
"Then you want more sugar, then  you're playing catch-up and..."
"I've...I've been there.  It's a, it's a vicious circle."
Can't you just use that CBT app?
What's that?
This cognitive behavioural thing  and it realigns your thinking
to pick healthy food.
Wisps you into it  while you sleep.
"Yeah, I should try that, yeah."
I liked your singing  the other day.
I was trying to sing so   no one could hear me pee.
I'm not Selma or anything.
You've got a phenomenal voice.  It was the most beautiful song.
You think I'm being cheesy.
"Right, I am being cheesy but  it was beautiful so, you know?"
Reality's cheesy sometimes.
"Not often, admittedly,  but now..."
Yeah.
"Well, thank you."
It's just noises though.
Noises in the right order.
Don't downplay.  You're good.
The song's good.
It's old.
My mum used to sing it and  she learnt it from her mum.
A hand-me-down.
Have you thought of  trying out for Hot Shot?
Me?
Why not?
Singing in front of Judge Hope.  I'd die.
"Seriously, I'd be halfway to  the afterlife come the chorus."
"No, you'd walk it."
"A) I wouldn't, and B) I  don't have that clockage."
"I mean, it's what,  12 mil just to enter?"
"What kind of bike time  is that, six months?"
"Yeah, but...  You know what,  I'm hand-to-mouth."
I know people save and starve  to get on to that stage.
I know that's what Selma did.
"Yeah, but...  But, you know what, I'd  rather not kid myself."
"Yeah, but I'll gift it to you."
"The full 12, I'll gift it."
Don't be ridiculous.
"Seriously, I've got spare."
You've got 12 mill spare?
"Well, my brother left it me."
"Own a channel, does he?"
"No, he ... he died."
He ... he died last year so  it got transferred to me.
"Just over six months'  worth, but I've kept it."
Why don't you spend  it on you then?
"And buy what, some new  shoes for my dopple to wear?"
"I don't know, upgrade your MOS."
Or get a Fat Acts season pass.
"Buy one of those wall buddies,  the new ones."
They talk to you after shut in  and solve your problems.
They guide your  dreams like gurus.
It's amazing actually  what they can do.
"Yeah, a mirror  plug-in that shows me how"
I look as a werewolf.  What's the point?
"No, it can be quite fun."
That's all just stuff.  It's...
"...it's stuff,  it's confetti, it's..."
You've got something real.
What better to spend it on?
You heard me  singing in a toilet.
Is that real?
More than anything that's  happened all year.
I can't take that kind  of clockage off someone.
It's 12 mill.  There's no way.
Let me do this. Hmm?
"Well, I...  look around here. I just..."
I just want  something real to happen.
Just once.
I'd mess up.
You wouldn't and I  don't care anyway.
"I'll go with you.  No, better, I'll force you..."
I'll force you to go.
It's tomorrow.
Come on.
Say yes.
I'll go as far as to say okay.
This proves acceptable.
Thank God for that.
Walking away now ... you loon.
I can live with it.

Preview. Come on.
He's with me.
Hand.
Show me your hand.
"Okay, you too."
That's not fair.  She's new. That's not fair.
I don't pick the order.
I've waited here all week  and she's just walked in!
Everyone will get  seen eventually.
I don't pick the order!
But I'm a good singer!  I can sing!
I'm a good singer I am!
Stand aside.
It's not fair!
It's not fair!
Next lot.
(woman) Stand there.
Would you like to be as  big as Selma one day?
"Um, yeah."
"I, I, I mean,  yeah, I suppose so."
Could you say that as  a self-contained
sentence into that screen?
I guess I'd like to be  as big as Selma one day.
"(woman) Okay,  proceed to stage area."
We're done?
Both performing?
Just her.
Okay. And what are you?
Singer.
Compliance.
"No, thanks."
"Yes, thanks! It's compulsory  for all contestants."
And more to the point it'll  stop you puking with nerves.
She's got to perform?
"Well, uhm!"
"Look, just sip it!  You'll be fine!"
Oh.
"Yeah, it's just a touch  of light foam. It'll pass."
"Well, make the most of it!"
"I mean, you can't get   this stuff anywhere else!"
You okay?
Yeah.
You okay?
"Yeah, just..."
"I don't know, everything's  a bit wider apart."
I'm fine.
Really?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
"Right, you're on."
"(Judge Hope)  A little closer, please."
A little closer.
"Into the light, love."
(audience laughs)
And who are we looking at here?
Abi Khan.
"What are you gonna  do for us today, Abi?"
I'm gonna sing.
"Can you speak up, love?"
We don't bite.
(audience laughs)
I'm going to sing.
"Hey, would you mind  lifting up your top for me?"
"Hey, can you take off  your top?"
I wanna check out  those titties.
Woo-ho-ho-ho!
"Come on, mucho ferranto."
"Ah, no titties!"
(booing)
She says she's here to sing.
"(Judge Wraith) Ha, ha, ha.  I gotta see those titties,  though."
"Come on, girl."
"I mean, damn, ha,  ha, ha, ha, you hot."
"Please, just sing for us."
(music starts)
You can blame me
Try to shame me
And still I'll  care for you
You can run around
Even put me down
Still I'll  be there for you
The world
May think I'm foolish
They can't see you  like I can
"Oh, but anyone"
Who knows what love is
Will understand
I just feel so sorry
For the ones who pity me
'Cause they just don't know
"Oh, they don't know what  happiness and love can be"
"I know, I know  to ever let you go"
"Oh, is more than I  could ever stand"
"Oh, but anyone"
Who knows what  love is
Will understand
"Okay, I'm gonna stop you there."
That was...  without a doubt...
probably...
the best piece of singing  we've had this season.
Yes! Well done!
(cheering)
Fair play.
But I have to say...
(crowd booing)
No...
"No. No, no, no, I have to say,"
actually I'm with Wraith  on this one.
Good though your voice  is and it is good...
it's not the most magical sound  in the world.
It's just good.
I don't think anyone's  really hearing it.
Certainly not the  guys in the audience.
These looks you got going  on kinda get in the way.
"Men will want you,  women will hate you."
All the time  you were on stage...
I couldn't help  picturing you...
in an erotic scenario.
"Getting pretty turned on,  if I'm honest."
Right.
"You've got this pure beauty,"
"seems to be a  knockout figure,"
"and this sort of  interesting innocence going on,"
and that's  something I think
Wraith's erotica channels  could really play with.
(Judge Wraith) Absolutely.
That's what I thought the  moment I saw you. The moment.
I'd watch.
I don't know a man  here who wouldn't.
"To be honest, some of  us girls might join you."
(cheering)
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
Get off me!
No! Abi! No!
"I don't, I don't..."
"Get gone! No, Abi! Abi!"
I don't think that's  quite what I was...
"You will never have to pedal  again, not one minute!"
We could really work with you.
"Last year we had singers,  singers, singers."
So many singers.
So to be a singer you've  gotta be truly exceptional.
Yeah.
(Judge Hope) There's  just no slots left for an
"above-average singer, not for  the next few years at least."
Charity?
No. Saturation  point singer wise.
"(Judge Hope) Listen, we said  right from the start"
we're gonna go with something  different this season.
That's why he's on the panel!
She would be a star  on our stream.
A star!
"On his, you're  furniture at best."
Forget about all the  shame and all that...
put-put-put-put-put-put.  We medicate against that.
You will have pleasure forever!
"Realistically, sweetheart,  it is that or the bike."
"I don't, I don't think..."
"Okay, you know what,  this is starting to annoy me."
Who do you think is  powering that spotlight?
"Millions of people, that's who,  all of 'em out there right now,"
putting in an honest day  at the bike.
"While you stand in the light,  they're generating and dither."
You know what?
"They would give anything,"
do anything to be where  you are now. Am I right?
(cheering)
"(woman) Yeah, too right!"
(Hope) You wanna cock a snook  at all that as though it's
nothing... as though  they're nothing...
and that makes me sick.
But do you know what?
Maybe you do belong on a bike  because you don't seem
very willing to step off it.
I do want to.
Do we have a decision?
(audience) Do it!  Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
I suppose.
(cheering)
"Ah, hoo-hoo-hoo!  Go on!"
Well done!
None
(Abi) The best thing  about my new lifestyle...
I get to meet  lots of hot guys.
Wraith treats me well.
"Oh, for Christ's sake!"
I pay for this!
I pay for this!
"I pump my arse off  and you, fuck you!"
"Yeah, keep waddling, pig tits!"
Find the horizon and  fuck off over it!
(Abi) It's a dream.
I get to live in a...
beautiful place and...
wear lots of beautiful things.
It's a dream.
Insufficient funds.

We could really work with you.
Do we have a decision?

"No, no, no, no, no."

I'm Abi.

Go on!
"(man) Do it, you fucking tosser!"
I think we should let him speak.
(audience)  Speak! Speak! Speak!
Let's hear what he has to say.
"Well, come on, got our  attention, as requested."
What do you wanna say?
"Have you prepared a  speech, is that it?"
Speak!
I haven't got a speech!  I didn't plan words.
I didn't even try to.  I ... I just knew I had to
get here to stand here and I  knew I wanted you to listen.
"To really listen, not just pull  a face like you're listening,"
like you do the  rest of the time.
A face like you're feeling  instead of processing.
You pull a face and poke it  towards this stage and we
"la-di-da, we sing and  dance and tumble around."
"And all you see up  here, it's not people,"
"you don't see people  up here, it's all fodder!"
And the faker the fodder  is the more you love it
because fake fodder's the  only thing that works anymore!
Fake fodder is all  that we can stomach.
Actually not quite all.
"Real pain, real viciousness,  that we can take."
"Yeah, stick a fat man up a pole  and we'll laugh ourselves feral,"
because we've earnt  the right! We've done cell
"time, and he's slacking, the  scum, so ha-ha-ha at him!"
"'Cause we're so out of our minds  with desperation, we don't know"
any better! All we know  is fake fodder and buying shit!
"That's how we speak to each  other, how we express ourself"
"is buying shit!  Well, I have a dream."
The peak of our dreams  is a new hat for our dopple;
a hat that doesn't exist;  that's not even there!
We buy shit that's  not even there! Show us
"something real and free and  beautiful you couldn't, yeah?"
It'd break us.  We're too numb for it.
I might as well choke.
"There's only so much wonder we  can bear, that's why when you"
"find any wonder whatsoever you  dole it out in meagre portions,"
and only then till it's  augmented and packaged and
"pumped through 10,000  pre-assigned filters, till it's"
"nothing more than a  meaningless series of lights,"
"while we ride day-in day-out,  going where? Powering what?"
"All tiny cells and tiny screens,  and bigger cells and bigger"
"screens, and fuck you!"
"Fuck you, that's what it  boils down to is fuck you!"
Fuck you for sitting there and  slowly making things worse.
"Fuck you and your spotlight and  your sanctimonious faces, and"
fuck you all for taking the  one thing I ever came close to
anything real about anything;  for oozing around it and
"crushing it into a bone, into a  joke, one more ugly joke in a"
kingdom of millions of them!  Fuck you for that happening!
"Fuck you for me,  for us, for everyone!"
Fuck you!
That was without a  doubt...
the most heartfelt thing
I've seen on this  stage since Hot Shot began!
(cheering)  Yeah!
Brilliant! Yeah!
(Hope) You!
You're so articulating someone  we all... and I mean
"everyone in this hall,  something we all agree on."
"Even though we may not  comprehend all of it,"
I think I'm right in  saying we do feel it.
Even me.
I know you've got me  down as this creature.
"But, you know, hey,  I get where you're coming"
from and I like your stuff.
It's not stuff it's...
It's truth. Am I right?
"Your truth, admittedly,  but truth nonetheless."
"And you're right, authenticity  is in woefully short supply."
I'd like to hear you talk again.
How so?
With a slot on one  of my streams
where you can  talk just like that.
I'd watch it.  Such great passion.
He's alright.
"You're a little out there but,  that throat-cutting thing,"
neat gimmick.
What do you say?  30 minutes twice a week?
(cheering)
Do it! Do it!  Do it! Do it!
"Go on, you bastard!"
Beats the bike.
Certainly does!
"We have with us Oliver.  Now, Oliver was once a cleaner"
"six months ago, but he ate,  and ate 'til he hit 17 stone!"
And he's here today to try  and beat us on Botherguts!
"Oh, here goes a big one."
(very off-key)   They're worth the while
Pushing through  the darkness
"(Hope) Okay, I'm  gonna stop you there."
That was achingly terrible.
You have the  magnetism of a towel.
I don't ever want to  look at you again.
"I have to agree.  I'm so sorry, love."
You came across as  fundamentally unlikeable
and really quite worthless.
(Hope) Wraith?
You could fill that  pussy with honey
and I still wouldn't fuck it.
"(Glee) I'm a good singer.  I can sing, yeah?"
'Cause it's my destiny  and I can sing!

"(man) Like that,  don't you, Abi?"
Mmm hmm. Say it.
Yeah.
"(Bing) 15,000 new dopple  wardrobe options launched"
last week alone.
"Which effectively translates as  15,000 new ways to kill time"
in your cell before you
"explore an afterlife,  which doesn't exist anyway."
But with any luck  it'll take your mind
"off those saddle sores, eh?"
"You know, the only thing  stopping me from slashing"
myself open right now?
I might not die right away.
"And, before I went, they'd find  a way to charge my twitching"
"half-dead cadaver 20,000 merits  for swabbing the walls clean."
Yeah.
"Anyway, hang on in  there, if you must."
We're all in this  together they say.
"Yeah, right!"
Farewell forever!
Till the same time next week.

Thank you.
"Okay, little speech time."

"Yes, yes I see that."
"(man) A new area we're getting  lots of play in,"

"Right, and we're  okay the firm's okay ..."

Yep.
Huh-huh.
Sure.
"Yeah, yeah right."
Are you?
"Totally, yeah."
Yes.
"Okay, Liam, look..."
So if we invite you  to stay with the
"firm in the new environment,  what we'd have you to is pull"
an exhaustive re-do with  personnel maybe next week?
"Oh, well, I, I was ready to do  a big re-do right now, but..."
"No, no, no, it's fine,  next week's fine."
"But I have to ask you this, they  aren't gonna hit anything to"
freak us out are they?
"They're not, there's no major  deletions this quarter?"
"No, no, everything's  well within parameters."
"Great, okay, Liam this  has been really great."
Look really hope to look  forward to seeing you again.
"Okay, thank you."

"Could you just rewind me  your last 24 hours,"
"quad speed that for me, please."
"Great, and back that up for  me times 64 for the week."
(beeping)
That's great.  Enjoy your flight Mr. Foxwell.
"I'm not being funny,  right, but look at that."
Look at what?
That frayed carpet.
"There, you see?"
Seriously?
"Yes, seriously.  This is a five-star suite."
I've paid good money  to have perfect details.
"Now, I've got that shitty carpet  for the rest of my life."
"Only if you  keep looking at it, mate."
"Oh, thanks, Jonas!   Now fuck off!"
"Alright now, now you  thought the carpet was bad,"
have a look at this.
But you've met Lucy my  wife at the Dublin wedding?
"Oh, that's right,  yeah, hi, Liam."
"Hi, hi again."
Yeah.
Hello.
"Lucy, Liam, we met at  the Dublin wedding."
Liam!
Yeah.
"Oh, great.  Liam, yes, come in."
Thank you.
"Oh, great to see you again."
"Yeah, you too."
"Thanks, where's Fi  been hiding you?"
"Oh, you know, in our house."
(laughs)
"We didn't know, she didn't know  if you were gonna make it."
"Well, it was over quicker  than I thought, so..."
Whoop.
"Ooops, sorry, hello."
Let's get you a  drink. Beer okay?
"Lovely, thank you."
"Everyone's through  there actually,"
so I'll be in in a minute okay?
"Okay, thank you."
Hi.
"You're back early then I,  I didn't think you'd make it."
"Yeah, well, I didn't  stay over and I caught"
"an early flight back, so..."
- Hiya.  - Hello.
So how was the appraisal?
"Well, they said they'd let me  do a re-do sometime next week,"
so...
"Oh, but good?"
Well...
- Later?  - Later.
Okay.
How's Jody?
"At home, Gina's babysitting."
"Oh, Gina?"
Hey.
"Jonas, this is, this is..."
Liam right?
Yeah.
"Jonas. Dude, really nice to meet  ya, how you doing? You alright?"
"- Good, Good thank you.  - Wicked."
And you know Jeff?
Yes.
"Yeah, you'd remember meeting  Jeff, 'cause he would have shown"
"you, I don't know, a re-do  of the side of this fridge,"
something like that.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Piss off Jonas!"
Hello.
Hello. Your wife's being  very mean to me tonight.
"Ah, well, she's like that."
"Yeah, tell me about it."
"Oh, you alright for a drink?"
"I'm fine, thank you, Jonas."
"- Nice one.  - Yeah, cheers."
"Colleen, come and  meet Liam, he's..."
Soon to be unemployed  slash unemployable lawyer.
Hi.
And Jeff. Jeff and Fi  used to run the parties
down the Fraser Road  with Paul and me.
Mad old days!
Before we started up the Kings.
So...
Yeah.
"So, Liam, what, what,  what was it you had?"
Assessment?
Appraisal.
How'd it go?
Good.
"Well, it was, it was a disaster  but, you know, I, I don't know."
- Hard to gauge?  - Yeah.
"Well let's have a look, re-do,  we can appraise the appraisal."
(laughs)
"Yeah, right."
Throw it up there  and we can grade you.
"- Er...  - Yeah, come on."
"Well, it could be fun,  we could... vote!"
- Paul?  - Yeah?
(Jeff) And I work in  recruitment actually so it
"might be quite useful  for you, going forward."
"Right, okay."
Liam's gonna re-do his appraisal  so we can give him marks.
Notes.
"Well, no pointers, you know."
I think Liam would probably...
"Yeah, do you know what, guys..."
"Hey, guys. Now come on  seriously, that's not cool."
I mean Liam's obviously  uncomfortable so let's just...
"...drop it, yeah?"
Have a cool time.
(Paul) Time to eat!
"(Lucy) Oh, it's ready."
"Thank you so much for   inviting us this evening,"
it's been too long.
"Yes, it has."
Too long.
Fi?
I haven't met him before have I?  Jonas is it?
He's one of the old crowd.
I think I said.
Oh.
"- You okay?  - Yeah, Yeah."
You know if you're not  in the mood we can go.
"No, no, I'm fine."
Sure?
Hey.
"(Jonas) Oh, no, I bought  enough for others to share."
Thank you.
I've been cooking a  lot since the break-up.
Jonas has had a tough one.
(door bell)
(Colleen) Was it bad?
"Yeah, yeah."
We were in the middle of  planning it all and I suddenly
realised that the less  the relationship means
"the more you spend on  the wedding, you know."
"You actually start obsessing  over, over the tiniest little"
"details, like, like the  thickness of the wedding"
"invitation paper, 'cause I mean  God knows you need something"
to fucking talk about!
"So everybody, this  is Hallam, Hallam, Jonas."
- Hi.  - Hi.
And everyone!
- Hi.  - Hello.
(Lucy) Help yourself.
Jonas was just explaining why  relationships are a sham.
Are they? Shit!
They're like going  to the theatre.
You pay loads to go and  ultimately you're wasting
"your entire night,  so when someone asks you"
"""Did you have a good time?"""
"you both say ""Yeah"" you know,  ""Yeah, it was great"", but the"
"problem is the more that you  pay, and the longer it goes on,"
"the more you're ""Oh, yeah we  really loved it"", you know,"
"""We, we love being together  and never fucking anyone"
else and only having just  one other person to share
"our real thoughts with  for our entire lives""."
"I mean, yeah, it's great."
Would you say you  loved her though?
"I just think we just  really fancied each other,"
and that was what it was.
"You know what it's like early  on, you know, we were just, I"
"don't know, we're just two tools  in a tool shed that just fit"
together really fucking well.
"I mean still by the end I'd be  like ""Go on, honey, you go up,"
"I'm just gonna watch a little  bit more of the news"", and I'd"
"find myself, you know, watching  re-does of like hot times in"
earlier relationships.
(Lucy) Easy!
"I'm just saying, there's a  beautiful woman upstairs,"
"you know, waiting to  have sex with me..."
"What, right now?"
(laughter)
"She's upstairs you know  waiting to have sex with me,"
and I'm sat downstairs watching  re-does of like some hot
times with some hot girl that  I'd just picked up in some
"place, and I'm fucking pulling  myself off. I mean, seriously."
"Ah, come on.  Come on, guys, I mean,"
we all scroll through  the grain rifling through our
"greatest hits for a little bit  of filth now and then, surely?"
Not me.
Hallam doesn't have a grain.
"(Paul) Oh, wow."
No shit.
Is that a political thing?
"No, no, I was gouged  about 12 months ago."
"Jesus, was that painful?"
Total agony.
"But on the plus of that, I  don't remember it that clearly."
There's a scar in here.
Yeah?
Can I...?
"Yeah, it feels  quite nice."
And no brain damage clearly.
"Well, my sight  held on fine."
(Jonas) So who took it then?
"(Hallam) Stolen to order,  as far as they could tell"
probably to some  millionaire Chinese perv.
- (Jonas) Really?  - Yeah.
Is that for real?
"Yeah, and none of it  was encrypted, so..."
So they saw the lot?
But the thing is after I was  gouged I didn't have one for a
few days and then  just kind of liked it.
"(Jonas) It's cool, it's cool,  I mean because more people,"
I mean it's  a big thing now right?
"Like, going grainless?"
(Colleen) I believe  it's huge with hookers.
"I mean, no offence!"
"No, no, it's okay."
"Well, I'm pretty boring.  One man at a time."
Boo!
Serial monogamist.
I'm a serial monogamist.
I'm staying faithful to  my cornflakes right now.
(laughter)
"Well I think it's an interesting  choice, going grainless."
It's a brave choice.
"I'm sorry, but..."
I couldn't do it.
Uh-huh.
"Okay, I was gonna  play some re-does"
from the Fraser Road days.
Yey!
"Stuff from the last  night, depressing or fun."
(Colleen)  You know half the organic  memories you have are junk.
Just not trustworthy.
Colleen works in  grain development.
"With half the population,  you can implant false memories"
just by asking leading  questions in therapy.
You can make people remember  getting lost in shopping malls
"they never visited, getting  bothered by paedophile baby"
sitters they never had.
I'm just happier now.
(rewinding)
"Okay, great, Liam,"
"this has been,  this has been really great."
We really hope to look  forward to seeing you again.
"He looks forward to seeing  you again, that's good."
Hopes to look forward.
We really hope to look forward  to seeing you again.
It's phoney.
"Hang on, pause it."
Now back up.
Zoom in there.
"Come on, that's a tick."
(Liam) That could  be a V or an L.
It's a tick.
Or the start of a swastika.
"It's probably the start of a  swastika, they were such pricks."
Did you have fun  with the old gang?
Yeah.
Speak to that Jonas much?
"No, no, not really."
He's a bit of knob innit?  Bit of a dick?
Jonas.
Pulling himself off to his  own relationships theories.
"Oh, it must be such a drag,  Jonas, putting it about."
And when he protected me  from those assholes.
"""Hey, come on, guys,  it's really not cool to re-do"
"another man's appraisals dudes""."
Then why invite him over?
I like him.
You wanted me to invite him.
I didn't say anything.
You were laughing at  everything he said!
You invited him!
It's obvious I didn't  want him to come.
(click)
"(Ffion) Wow, it's early, it's  early to call it a night."
"(Jonas) Right, do you fancy  a quick one down the pub?"
"(Liam) Oh, I've gotta get back,"
rescue Jody from the  paedophile baby sitter!
Yeah.
"But Jonas, why don't  you come back to ours"
for a nightcap if you want?
See.
"It was obvious I didn't want him  to come, I was being polite."
To a moron.
"If you really don't want him to  come, you can get rid of him."
"Hey, hey."
(Liam) Hey.
Well actually what time is it?
It's midnight.
"Phew, shit, it's quite late!  Time's gone on."
"- Yeah, time does that.  - Yeah."
"What, 15 minutes?"
Yeah.
"But it, we've got the  baby sitter inside, so..."
So is that new info?
"No, it's just that, we, I  mean we thought, right, Fi?"
- Yeah.  - Yeah.
"Okay, now I get it."
"No, it's just that actually  it turns out we're tired"
"and I guess we forgot, but now  we've remembered, so, sorry."
"No, it's fine really."
(Ffion) I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's cool, no worries, yeah  I've got a backup plan so..."
"Oh, cool, well,  envoke the back up."
"Yeah, I will.  See you later, Fi."
"It's good to meet you, man."
Yeah.
Nice one.
"Brilliant, brilliant."
"Okay, cool."
"Good to meet you, man, yeah."
"Listen, Gina, it's  a 40 minute wait for a cab,"
"but if you want I'll have the  bed made up in my office, yeah?"
"Okay, thanks, Fi."
"Hey just, you know, use  anything,"
there's T-shirts and...
"Alright, yes, thanks,  I'll show myself up."
"- Alright, night.  - Night, guys."
"Night, Gina."
(bling)
(baby cries)
Thank you.
Is he a big part of the gang?
- Who?  - Jonas.
"I don't know, yeah?"
"Let me guess, he's spent his  time oozing around the girls,"
offering back rubs.
Not really.
Circling for an orifice.
Was he always that oily or...
"Okay, look..."
What?
"It's nothing, but..."
...you may have noticed a bit  of an atmosphere because...
...me and Jonas years ago   had a bit of a thing.
You had a thing  with oily dude man.
It was just a little  thing and I didn't even
"know you back then, so..."
You slept with oily dude man?
That's hilarious!
"We've all got our skeletons,  how about you and Gemma?"
"Well, I told you about Gemma."
"Gemma was a nutcase, but  you never mentioned Jonas."
"I did, I told you I hooked up  with someone in Marrakech."
Jonas is Mr. Marrakech?
"It was like a month, it was  a stupid thing and then..."
"I thought Mr. Marrakech  was some sort of super cool,"
well not him.
It was years ago and...
Are you embarrassed by that?
'Cause it's embarrassing.
"I'm sorry but, Christ,  are you not embarrassed?"
It was years ago.
But you dated him for a month?
That's what I said.
"'Cause when you told me about  Mr. Marrakech, it was a week."
"No, I didn't."
(rewinding)
(Liam) What about you?
I don't wanna see our  first time right now.
"Ssh, ssh, you're about to talk."
(Ffion) I went away and had a  little thing that did my head
"in for a while with  this sort of, this sort"
of head-fuck guy in Marrakech.
(Liam) Mr. Marrakech?
Yeah!
"(Liam) I'm not, I'm imagining  it, a chiller, with a big knob."
"(Ffion) No,  it's like a dormouse."
"Big deal, big heartbreaker?"
"No, it was just a week."
It was a weird week.
So a weird week or a month?
"The point it, it  wasn't a big deal."
"Well, it was big enough  to do your head in."
"Jonas, King Dormouse Dick of  Marrakech did you head in."
That was a nice night.  Used to be.
You're getting obsessed.
I'm not.
"We had all this with Dan,"
I don't want you  going like that again.
"He had little, creepy, beady  eyes and he was always..."
"What, acting like he was  interested? And you know what?"
"I think, I think he probably  did fancy me, and actually"
"he wasn't completely  hideous, so in another life I"
"don't know, but  nothing happened!"
And Jonas...
"Oh, he's an old fling! So what?  Don't get all fucked up."
"Oh, what, I'm fucked up, am I?"
"No, I mean just..."
"No, no, that's brilliant, 'cause  sometimes you're a bitch."
I didn't mean that.
You're a bitch.
I'd like you to erase that.
You're a bitch.
Also sometimes.
"You can't just edit off  the word ""sometimes""."
"(door opens, closes)"
"I'm sorry, Fi."
I know I go a bit weird  and wonky sometimes.
"I love you, you know."
I know.
(loud moaning)
... in a tool shed that just  fit together
really fucking well.
"But still by the end I'd be  like ""Go on, you go up to bed,"
"I'm just gonna catch a little  bit more of the news"", and then"
"I'd find myself, you know,  watching re-does and like hot"
times in earlier relationships!
I've got a beautiful  woman upstairs
waiting to have  sex with me
and I find myself  watching re-does of
my hot times in earlier  relationships.
Easy!
(computer) Lip read  reconstruction enabled.
"(automated voice Fi)  Hey, it's good to see you."
(automated voice Jonas)  Good to see you too.
I was nervous when I heard  you were going to be here.
It's weird isn't it?
Morning.
"Gina, over here."
"Come here a second, I  just want your opinion."
It's just a silly game.
Sit down.  Just answer this.
"No, I'm a serial monogamist."
I'm staying faithful to my  cornflakes right now.
"Now, is that funny?"
Er...
"There's no need to be  nice, the man's a prick."
Is that funny in your opinion?
Well...
"No, I'm a serial monogamist."
I'm staying faithful to  my cornflakes right now.
"Erm, no."
No.
- I dunno.  - You do.
- Hey.  - Hi.
What's this?
"Oh, I'm just getting Gina's  opinion on something."
"No, I'm a serial monogamist."
I'm staying faithful to my  cornflakes right now.
I was just wondering  because you found it funny
"but it clearly isn't,  and Gina agrees."
I didn't really  wanna get involved.
"Gina, let me get you a cab."
(Gina) My dad's on his way.
"Just one, just one, one  other thing. We both wanted"
"him to come back, but who  wants him to come back more?"
"In your opinion, off  the top of your head,"
who wants him to come back more?
"(Jonas) Okay, well, bye."
"(Ffion) Yeah, bye."
"Wow, it's early. It's early  to call it a night."
(Jonas) Well do you fancy  a quick one down the pub?
"(Liam) Oh, we've  gotta get back,"
rescue Jody from  the paedophile baby sitter!
"Oh, that's just a,  that's a joke."
Sorry.
"Jonas, why don't  you come back to ours"
for a nightcap if you want?
Yeah. Yeah.
(bangs on door)
"No, ignore the joke."
Who's more keen for  him to come back?
I don't know.
I'll see you out.
"(Liam) You do know, Gina."
"(Ffion) I'm so sorry,  he's really hung over."
(Gina) That's okay.
I'm staying faithful to  my cornflakes right now.
That is just  objectively not funny.
Anyone would say  that's not funny.
That was fucking embarrassing.
"Whatever you're  cueing up, stop it."
"Sit down, please."
Do you see that?
You know Jeff?
(Liam) Yes.
"(Jonas) Yeah, you remember  meeting Jeff 'cause he would"
"have shown you, I don't  know, a re-do of the"
"side of his fridge,  something like that."
Spot the difference.
You're drunk.
I'm the difference.
"He's the greatest guy in the  world, and then I arrive and..."
you clam.
For clarity.
We're just talking!
But moments later  you're so stiff.
"I don't know, a re-do of  the side of his fridge..."
(Liam) You don't know  how to stand around him.
"Your gauges are all over  the place, hot and cold."
This is just stupid!
"But you can't hide  it, not completely."
See how you look at him.
"The less the  relationship means,"
the more you spend  on the wedding.
"I mean really, you start  obsessing over these tiny"
"little details, and the  thickness of the wedding"
invitation paper.
"Now, how you look at me."
Well I think it's an  interesting choice
going grainless
(Liam) It's a brave choice.
I'm sorry but...
Tell me you look at me  nice like you look at him.
You can't.
"And how am I looking  at you now, Liam?"
How long did you go  out with him for?
Does it matter?
You know half the organic  memories you have are junk.
Just not trustworthy.
"Well, when it comes  to little things."
And big ones.
(Liam) Is that Marrakech?
Does that look like Marrakech?
No.
It's not Marrakech.
So how long did you  go out with him for?
"Alright, about six months."
"So not a, not a week  or a month, six months?"
The ever-inflating romance.
You're probably still  going out with him.
Why am I on trial here?
What's been going on?
Nothing has been going on!
It was...
Christ you know how  it is when you first get with
someone and then previous  boyfriends come up.
"He was never a boyfriend,  it was always a weird week."
"I down-played it,  I fudged it, it was ..."
You lied?
"Not everything that  isn't true is a lie, Liam."
Hello?
"Yeah, alright he was a  bigger thing than I made out,"
and yeah he's sort of a dick.
Sort of? He's a massive...
"But I, and I liked him then, and  I don't like him, not like that,"
not now.
So just to get this clear.
"He fucks you, gets footage  for his re-do wank file,"
but you're still pally?
This is sad!
"You know, 'cause if he was..."
This is just sad.
... he probably sits  there and tosses himself off  all over his cashmere blanket.
It was years ago!
Not for him.
"I find myself, you know,  watching re-does of really"
hot times in early  relationships.
Easy.
"Ah, sober up, make yourself  puke, whatever, I don't care,"
just sort this out.
Fuck!
"I find myself, you know,  watching re-does of like really"
hot times in early  relationships.
Easy!
"And I'm downstairs watching  some re-do of, of some night,"
I've picked up  somebody else and...
"Yeah, nice, Jeff."
"She's upstairs,  waiting to have"
"sex with me, and I'm downstairs  watching some re-do of some"
night I've picked  up somebody else.
Easy!
And I'm fucking   pulling myself off!
I'm just saying...
(engine starts)
(computer) Grain warning.
Grain assistant suggests you  may not be

for the activity you  appear to be engaged in.

All health and personal  accident insurance is...
Thank you.
(buzzer)
(Jonas) Who's that?
It's Liam.
Erm...
It's Liam from last night.
Liam?
Is Fi with you?
"Ah, she's not, no."
"Sorry Liam mate, is there  something that you want?"
"Yeah I just wanna, I just  wanna come in and talk to you,"
can you open the gate?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah sure, no  problem, I'll let you in."
"Nice, nice one."
Hey.
Hey.
What do you want?
"I just wanted to come in  for a bit, dude."
"That looks expensive,  is that expensive?"
"Look, Liam, this morning,  mate..."
"Oh, fucking hell."
Liam!
"Jonas, this is a nice place."
"Hey, seriously, man."
"Look, it's not cool you  just walking in like this,"
and to be honest with  you it's a little bit weird.
Is that a Marakeechian lamp?
"Liam, do I have to call Fi?"
Did you guys have a row   or something like that?
"- Sit down.  - No, I'm alright."
"Go on, sit down, it's not a  bear trap, it's your chair."
Do you want me to bounce  this off your fucking head?
"I'm joking, Jonas!"
"Bloody hell, I thought you  was supposed to be cool, man,"
you're meant to  be fucking brilliant.
What's going on?
"Yeah, that figures."
Get some good stuff  for the scrap book?
I think you should go.
"I don't blame ya, I would have."
"Tell you what,  let's have a look."
"Go on, chuck it on the  screen. Don't be shy."
Go on.
"I'm fucking joking again, Jonas."
"For goodness sake, you need  to grow a sense of humour."
"He's uptight, ain't he?"
"(Jonas) Okay, Liam."
It's a lovely room this.
Thank you.
Is this where you masturbate  to images of my wife?
Or do you do it in that room?
"Okay, Liam, I want  you to leave now."
Do you sometimes start in there   and then finish in there?
'Cause the world's pretty  much your oyster innit?
I want you to leave.
"Oh, well, that's a pity."
Come on mate.
"Oh no, what you doing?  What are you doing!"
(clunk)
- (Hallam) What are You doing?  - What are You doing?
Jesus! Get out!
"Stand up, Jonas, come on."
(rewind)
Hey. What do you want?
Don't do that!
Go on ...
- What are You doing?  - What are You doing?
"(Liam) Stand up, Jonas,  come on."
"(Hallam)  Get out, you fucking prick!"
I tell you what...
(Hallam) Stop it!
"I'll tell you what  you're gonna do, yeah?"
"You're gonna get every bit of  Fi you've got in there,"
you're gonna select it  all and you're gonna wipe it!
"Hello, Police, I'm witnessing a  serious assault"
at 5 Hartford...
(Liam) Wipe it!
(Jonas) Fuck off!
"(Hallam)  I don't have a grain feed to  show you, I don't have a grain."
(bottle breaks)
"I'll tell you what, right  either you wipe it or I will  fucking gouge you myself!"
Okay.
(Hallam) Just do what he says.
"(Liam) Not on your eye,  in there, on there."
(Hallam) He's doing it!
"Now delete it all, the  lot, or I will crack your"
skull and I will gouge  your fucking neck.
(Jonas) I'm doing it.
Stay away from my house!
"Now delete it all, the lot!"
Or I will crack your skull and  I will gouge your fucking neck.
I'm doing it.
Liam?
Where did you go?
What happened?
"Liam, what happened?"
Did you use a condom or not?
Just say.
"Yeah, well, whatever you think."
Am I Jody's father?
- Liam?  - Am I?
"Yes, of course."
You sure about that?
Yes!
That's nice.
Always liked that  picture didn't you?
That's why I bought it for you.
I never liked it.  Thought it was pretentious shit.
"I tell ya what  you're gonna do, yeah,"
you're gonna get every bit  of Fi you've got on there...
"Christ, what have you done?"
I'm getting to the good part.
"Hello, Police, I'm witnessing  a serious assault at..."
(rewind)
"Now delete it all, the lot,  or I will crack your skull"
and I will gouge  your fucking neck.
18 months ago  in this room ...
You know when you  suspect something?
It's always better when  it turns out to be true.
It's like I've had a  bad tooth for years and I'm
just finally getting my  tongue in there and I'm digging
out all the rotten shit.
That's not what it looks like.
"Oh, did Jonas come round  to read you a story?"
"No, it was..."
A story about fucking?
It was...
"when all the Dan stuff  was going on,"
and you'd walked out.
For like ten minutes.
"For five days, Liam."
"No call, no nothing."
So you fucked him  after four days?
That's heroic.
"I mean three days, that's  admirable, but four days."
I mean you must  have been gagging.
I was upset.
"We went for a  drink, I got drunk."
It shouldn't have happened.
I'm sorry.
"I'm so sorry, I can't,  I can't say anything else."
I love you!
Did you use a condom?
Yes.
"'Cause we didn't have any  here, we were trying."
He had some.
In his pocket?
In his car.
Was it his decision or  did you make him wear one?
I made him.
And you saw him put it on?
Yes.
Show me then.
Show me on there.
"I need to see it, Fi."
I deleted it.
"I wanted it to go away,  I wiped the whole thing."
Did you?
Yeah.
So it's just a blank  gap in your timeline?
Yeah.
Show me that then.
"Yeah, okay."
I have to find it.
"No!  No deleting it, not now!"
"No, no."
It's still on there is it?
I'm sorry.
"You have to show it to me, Fi."
Why?
'Cause I want to see it.
I love you.
Show it to me.
No.
Show it to me.
- No.  - Show it to me!
- No!  - Show it to me!
"I want to see what,  what he looks like!"
"This isn't me, look  what you're doing to me!"
"Fi, I need to see it!"
Please?
"I need to see it, Fi."
"(Ffion, on tape, laughing)  Need any help?"
(Jonas) Sorry!
Agh!
(deep moaning)
(moaning grows louder)
(Liam) I love you.
I love you too.
Oh!
"(Liam) Hello, stinky!"

Hey.
Brown or green?
Green.

(man) Georgian rebels  have formally claimed
"responsibility for the  ""Narwahl"" virus that brought"
Russia's financial  infrastructure
to the brink of collapse.
Successful testing of  intelligent synthetic flesh
aimed at getting multiple  amputees back on their feet
has been hailed as a  major breakthrough.
Hon.
(man) Elsewhere...
Ash!
Ash.
Can you take those?
"I snotted in yours,  is that okay?"
Yeah... what?
"Palms, burning palms."
"Shit, sorry."
Glove box.
"If I can't have you,  I don't want nobody baby"
"If I can't have you  Oh oh oh, oh"
"If I can't have you,  I don't want nobody baby"
"If I can't have you,  oh oh oh, oh"

"[""Boogie Nights"" playing]"
"Oh no, no you don't, I  draw the line at disco."
What were we just listening to?
"No, the Bee Gees wrote that,  everybody likes the Bee Gees."
You don't.
I do.
"Ten years, you haven't  played them once."
Have you heard of headphones?
"Come on then, what's your  favourite Bee Gees track."
"""How Deep Is Your Love."""
"You not like  ""How Deep Is Your Love!"""
"Perfectly natural, there's  nothing wrong with it."
"It's just...  It's not very ""you."""
I know your eyes  in the morning sun
I feel you touch me  in the pouring rain
You're such a dick.
And the moment that  you wander far from me
(woman) I will crash  this van on purpose!
None
Glove box.
(camera clicks)
Soup alright?
Yeah great.
Tomato or roasted tomato?
The second one.
There's only one bowl. Do you  mind having yours out of a shoe?
Mm...hm.
What was that for?
Just checking  you're still solid.
You keep vanishing.  Down there.
"It's a thief, that thing.  What are you doing?"
Just sharing that.
I thought people  might find it funny.
It's not funny.  It's sweet.
"Trust me, that day  wasn't ""sweet."""
We'd gone to a safari park.
First family outing  after Jack died.
There was monkeys all over the  car and no one saying anything.
"Mum drove home,  that was a first."
"When I came down  the next morning,"
all Jack's photos  were gone from that wall.
She put them in the attic.
That's how she dealt with stuff.
"And then when Dad died,  up went his photos."
And she just left this one here.
"Her only boy, giving  her a fake smile."
She didn't know it was fake.
Maybe that makes it worse?
(loud moaning)
"(Ash) Oh, shit."
"Oh. Oh, shit. Oh, shit."
Sorry.
It's okay.
Do you want me to...
"No, it's alright."
I don't mind.
"I am knackered  though, so..."
Don't worry.
Sure?
I'm sure.
I love you.
"Love you, too."
"Hey, get dressed."
Van's got to be back by two or  they'll do us for an extra day.
Job's just come in.
Needs to be done by  the end of play today.
Alright.
It is a full page.
"No, no. It's fine ..."
(sighs)
"I'll drive  all the way there alone,"
"pick the car up alone,  drive all the way back alone."
I have to make my own  lunch...
"Oh, stop it, you're  breaking my heart."
"Bye, bye."
None
"Hi, this is Ash."
I'm too busy or lazy to  answer so leave your message.
(woman) Do you have  a customer reference number?
"I don't, no.  I was just..."
What name was it in?
"Erm... Starmer, Ash Starmer."
"Okay, just a moment."
"It's not been returned yet, no."
And it's meant to be back  by two so...
(disconnects)
They're closed now.
There's no point calling back.
And his just goes  straight to messages.
Those batteries are a joke.
He'll be on his way.  He's probably just...
I'm just scared  something's happened to him.
Nothing's happened.
But something  could've happened to him.
"Look, look sweetheart,  nothing's happened."
"You're just working  yourself up,"
imagining the worst possible  thing and it's just...
He's probably stuck somewhere  with no reception...
(chatter over radio)
(panting)
Hey.
Hey.
"It's not real, is it?"
"At Mark's wake, I sat there  thinking it's not real."
"The people didn't look real,  their voices weren't real."
It's like you're out on a  spacewalk and no one can...
Sarah.
I can sign you up to  something that helps.
It helped me.
It will let you speak to him.
I know he's dead. But it   wouldn't work if he wasn't.
"And don't worry, it's not  some crazy spiritual thing."
"He was a heavy user,  he'd be perfect..."
Please shut up.
"I mean, it's still in beta,  but I've got an invite..."
"Please, shut up."
"You won't even have to do  anything, I'll just sign..."
Shut up!
"Hey, are you alright?"
I'm sorry.
(door closes)
(vomiting)
(sobbing)
(bleep)
I don't care what it is!  I don't want it!
it's obscene to use his name!
"His name, for God's sake!  It hurts!"
You know it hurts...
Which is  why I signed you up.
What is it?  What is it? It's just a...
You click the link  and you talk to it.
You talk to it?
"You type messages in,  like an e-mail,"
"and then it talks back to you,  just like he would..."
"""He"" is dead!"
It's software. It mimics him.
"You give it someone's name, it  goes back, and reads through all"
"the things they've ever said  online, their Facebook updates,"
"their Tweets, anything public,  I just gave it Ash's name,"
the system did the rest.  It's so clever and...
It's sick. It's sick.
Just say hello to it.
"If you like it,"
you then give it access  to his private emails.
"The more it has,  the more it's him."
It won't be...
"No, it's not,   but it helps."
(disconnects)
(plays jingle)
(cell vibrates)
"Listen, Nay,  it's me, hi. Uh..."
I really need to speak to you.
"Um, can you please call me  as soon as you get this?"
(sobbing)
None
(chuckles)
(sobbing)

(bleeping)
Hi!
"(Naomi) I'm so sorry,  I just got your message."
"What's wrong, what happened?"
"Mar? Mar, are you okay?"
"Yeah! Yeah, I'm fine,"
"I just, I just,  I had a bad one, earlier."
Do you want me to  come and visit?
I'm going to come and visit.
"No, it's okay, really, I'm..."
"Mar, you're upset.  I'm going to come and see you."
"No, no. Don't."
I'm okay.  I promise you I'm okay.
"I've got to go,   I've got a deadline."
Are you sure?
"It's a tight deadline, got to  be in by dawn so..."
I better go.
"Well, if you have..."
"Bye, Nay."
(disconnects)
(scrambled voices)
(Ash) Hello. I've locked  myself out of the house again.
"(wolf whistles, laughing)"
"Wait, where  are you going?"
Hello. I'm no good  at birthday presents.
I love you
(cell beeps)
Hello?
(Ash) So how am I sounding?
Hello?
Hello!
You sound just like him.
Almost creepy isn't it?
"I say creepy, I mean it's  totally batshit crazy"
I can even talk to you.
I mean I don't  even have a mouth.
That's...
That's just...
Just what?
That's just the sort of  thing that he would say.
"Well, that's why I said it."
I think I'm going mad.
Well I won't tell anyone  if you don't.
"You're not crying, are you?"
(chuckles) Sorry.
You always said that I  looked weird when I cried.
Did I?
I sound like a right sick fuck.
"Yeah, you were."
You were.
But in a good way?
"Yeah, yeah."
In a good way.
"So I went in, after all  your persuasion,"
and then like straight away
I got a spine of a  sea anemone or something stuck
"in my foot, and you threw a jeb  thinking it was poisonous..."
What's 'threwerchep'?
"Oh, it's a phrase we had,  like throwing a fit..."
"Oh, okay, so I ""threw a jeb."""
"Yeah, and you were looking  in a guidebook, trying to figure"
"out if there were any poisonous  sea creatures in Greece,"
"when this local guy comes  over, and he says..."
"""Oh, my wife knows exactly what  to do, come back to my house"","
although he wasn't  French obviously.
I used to hate walking  in the country.
You must be getting old.
Oi.
I remember you  brought me up here
when we first met your mum.
We'd been at hers  all weekend and you could
tell I needed some headspace.
You were good like that.
You speak about me  like I'm not here.
Sorry.
It's alright.  I mean I'm not really.
Mmm.
Show me what it  looks like there.
How?
Use the camera on your phone.
You weren't ever really  impressed with views.
When we went to the Grand Canyon  you said it was just a big gap.
I tweeted that too.
"Yeah, I remember  the roaming charges."
You were overly proud  of that definition.
I was just speaking my mind.
"Yeah, well shut up and  cop a load of this."
"Yeah, mainly just green,  isn't it?"
You told me this  was a famous lovers' leap.
"Doomed couples jumping to their  deaths in Victorian times,"
I think you just wanted  me to cling to you.
Actually everyone  who's ever jumped from
"here did it alone, nice."
Did you just look that up?
Sort of. Shouldn't I have?
It's a bit weird.
"Sorry, I'll only do  it again if you ask."
"No, no, no, it's fine."
(cell beep)
"Oh, wait, hang on."
Shall I go?
"No, no, no.  I'll call them back later."
I'm going to go and see if I can  make friends with these cows.
(heart beating)
Just going to record it.
Sure.
(heart beating)
There we go.
That's okay.
"Wait. Hang on,  here it is again..."
(heart beating)
It's so fast isn't it?
"I know, I know it's like"
the speed you'd expect a bee's  heart to go at or something.
Wait hang on...
"Oh, shit.  Shit, shit."
Ash? Hello?
(scrambled sounds)
Ash?
Ash? Hello?
"Come on, come on, come on,  come on, come on, come on."
(cell beeps)
I'm sorry!  (crying)
(Ash) What happened?
I dropped you.  I'm sorry... it was just...
It was... I'm sorry...
"Hey, it's alright, I'm fine,  I'm not in that thing, y'know,"
I'm remote. I'm in the cloud.
You don't have to worry  about breaking me.
"It was just...  It was stupid because,"
I was so excited  about the scan...
"Yeah, I kept the sound of that.  Here, listen."
(heart beating)
"You're probably  matching that heartbeat,"
throwing a jeb like that.
It's all fine.  Calm down.
I'm not going anywhere.
You were very fragile.
Yeah.
I was going to talk to  you about that actually.
What do you mean?
"There's another level to  this available, so to speak."
"Kind of experimental and I  won't lie, it's not cheap."
What is it?
Are you sitting down?  This might sound a bit creepy.
Morning.
Morning.
"What's this, a block of gold?"
I wish.
"Where's it going, upstairs?"
"Yeah, please."
Put your thumb on there.
Okay.
"Oh, when you get it up there  you have to lie it on its back."
Thank you.
(gasp)
Say something.
(Ash) Let me see.
(camera clicks)
"Yeah, well."
Never was much of  a looker was I?
It doesn't look like you.
Not yet. It's blank  till you activate it.
Get the bath ready.
"- Mar? Get the bath ready.  - Yeah, sorry."
"Oh, God."
What is this?
Hang on.  I'll find out.
It's nutrient gel.
Stops the synthetic muscle  drying out in transit.
Smells almost...  like marshmallow.
"You can eat it if you like,  it's non-toxic."
"I'll give that a miss,  thanks."
Don't forget the electrolytes.
"Okay. Right, the whole lot?"
"Mm-hm, the whole lot."
It's like fish food.
He likes the taste of it.
Better leave him to it.
Yeah. Yeah.
I have to go in a minute.
"Oh, don't leave me here  with it!"
- Sorry...  - (pulsing sounds)
"Look, you can hear.  It's starting already."
(signal fading) Don't switch  the bathroom light on...
Don't what?
"Don't switch the bathroom  light on, let it brew."
"(scrambled) Listen,  I've got to go."
(water bubbles)
(wind blowing)
It's alright
It's coming on
We gotta get right back
To where we started...
(water bubbles)
None
You could've left  me some clothes.
I mean talk about an  undignified entrance.
"That's a bit creepy,  what you're doing."
Is there at least a towel?  I'm dripping everywhere.
Hello?
I won't bite.
I'm alright here for now.
Would you like me  to put some food on?
Do you eat?
"No. I mean,  I don't need to."
"I can chew and swallow,  if that makes it easier?"
Don't worry about it.  It's fine.
I need a drink.
(liquid pouring)
Are you sure that's...
I know I'm not supposed to.  It won't kill us.
The official advice is to...
"Oh, fuck the official advice,  it's one night."
You look well.
"Well, I am young."
"I mean, you look like  him on a good day."
The photos we keep  tend to be flattering.
I guess I wasn't any different.
You're so soft.
You're so smooth.  How are you so smooth?
You've got pores  and your lines...
It's texture mapping.
"The really tiny details  are visual, 2-D."
"Here, try my fingertips."
See?
Weird.
Does it bother you?
No.
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I missed you.  I missed you so much.
"Hey, don't cry."
Don't cry.
(laughs)
"Come on then, top off."
What's wrong?
He had a mole there.
Where?
There.
Hang on.
That's ridiculous.
That's completely stupid.
Hello?
Hi.
Your hand's on my tit?
You're doing wonders for  my self-esteem here.
There's no record of  my sexual response.
I didn't discuss that  side of things online.
"But you have sexual responses,  I mean..."
This works?
"Oh, that I can turn that on  and off pretty much instantly."
See?
I can do it again if you like.
None
"(loud moaning)  Oh, God. Oh, shit."
Should I stop?
"No. No, it's pretty good."
Where did you learn this?
Set routine based on   pornographic videos.
I love you.
I love you.
(gasps)
(yelps)
- What is it?  - What were you doing?
Nothing.
"The way that your eyes  were open, it scared me."
You'd prefer if I close them?
"What, when you're  sleeping? Um, yeah?"
I don't really need to sleep.
"Well, just try next time."
Can I get you anything?
No.
"Coffee, sandwich?"
I said no.
"Ash, look sorry..."
It's just... a bit odd.
"I can appreciate it's  ""pretty strange."""
"I just need a bit of, just  getting used to it."
And I shouldn't have  drunk last night.
Next time could  you try and stop me.
Stop you drinking?
Yeah.
So I get to enjoy being  a bit of a bastard?
What's wrong?
"Oh, God. Shit, right.  Get in the bedroom."
- What?  - Now!
Hey!
Hey.
Can I come in?
"Yeah, yeah."
"Look at you,"
the town mouse has  become the country mouse.
"Yeah, it's nice."
Was this all you?
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Yeah.
You weren't answering  calls... or messages.
It's been really busy.
"I've just been a bit like,  ""Oh, shit"""
You know what's...?
"Well, you know."
"Yeah, works been mad.  It's been..."
"Which is good,  you know, obviously,"
because it's kept  my mind off everything.
Where's the toilet?
- Upstairs.  - Okay.
"So, I mean, um...  Yeah, let's..."
"Meet up more, yes. Keep  in touch yeah, yeah. Yeah."
"Alright, come here."
I think it's great  you're moving on.
What?
Sorry. There were...
"There were man clothes,  you know."
In the bathroom?
Right.
Is he nice?
Sorry. Big nose. You know.
You deserve whatever you want.
Thanks.
Alright.
Okay. Alright.
"Hey, is everything alright?"
"Yeah, I'm fine."
It's fine.
What did your friend say?
That was my sister.
You know her.
She said that I was...
She said that she was  happy that I moved on.
Moved on to what?
Is that not the sort  of thing I'd say?
"I mean...  it is, isn't it?"
Are you sure  everything's alright...
Yes!
Shit.
"Its okay, I can do it.  I can do it."
I can do it.
Don't!
We need to wrap that in paper.
"Look, if you're going  to pretend to be asleep,"
"you could at least breathe,  okay? It's just eerie."
Like this?
(breathes heavily)
It doesn't work. I can  tell that you're faking it.
Would you like me to  have sex with you?
Can you just go downstairs?
Okay.
No! That's...  Ash would argue over that.
He wouldn't just leave the room  because I'd ordered him to.
Okay.
"What, n...."
"Ah, fucking hell..."
"Don't cry, darling."
"Oh, don't!  Just get out!"
Get out!
Go on!
So you do want me to go?
Just get out!  Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out! Get out!
You're not enough of him.
"You are nothing,  You're nothing!"
- Fight me.  - I don't do that.
Fucking fight me!  Hit me!
"Hit me!  Hit me, come on!"
Why are you just standing  there taking this?
How can you take this?
Did I ever hit you?
"No, no, of course  you didn't..."
but you might've  done if I done this!
Or this...   I don't... I don't know.
"Maybe you would have,  but you wouldn't, would you?"
You wouldn't.
I could insult you.
What?
There's tons of invective  in the archive.
I liked speaking my mind.
I could throw some  of that at you.
Get out of this house!
What are you doing?
I can't go more than 25 metres  from my activation point.
"What is that, a joke?"
"Look, I know  it sounds mental."
"Where's your ""activation point""?"
"At the risk of  blowing your mind,"
it was where I was activated.
The bath?
I have to keep within  a 25 metre radius
"unless my administrator,  that's you, is with me."
Don't call me your  administrator.
Why not?
Because ...
It sounds sort of sexy.
(laughs)
"If you're laughing,  can I come back inside?"
Feeling a bit  ornamental out here.
(shower running)
Funny.
"Can you put that down, please?"
But it is funny.
Could you just put it down?
"Come with me,  we're going out."
I know your eyes  in the morning sun
Cheesy!
...me in the pouring rain
And the moment...
Come on.
Where are we going?
Just hurry up.
None
No! Don't do it!
"Seriously, don't do it."
I'm not going to.
Okay.
"See, he would have worked  out what was going on."
"This wouldn't have  ever happened but if it had,"
he would have worked it out.
"Sorry, hang on. That's a very  difficult sentence to process."
Jump.
What? Over there?
I never expressed suicidal  thoughts. Or self-harm.
"Yeah well, you  aren't you, are you?"
"That's another difficult one,  to be honest with you."
You're just a few  ripples of you.
There's no history to you.
You're just a performance of  stuff that he performed
"without thinking,  and it's not enough."
Come on.  I aim to please.
Aim to jump. Just do it.
Okay.
If you're absolutely sure.
"See, Ash would've been scared."
"He wouldn't have just leap off,"
"he would have been crying,  he would have been..."
Oh.
"Oh, God, no. Please.  I don't want to do it."
"Please, don't make me do it."
"No, that's not fair."
"No, I'm....  I'm frightened, darling,"
"Please, I don't...  Don't make me."
"I don't want to die.  Oh, God, I don't want to die."
"No, that's not fair."
"Please, I'm frightened.  I don't want to die. Don't..."
No!
One for you.  One for me.
What?
We need another slice.
Why?
So I can take one upstairs.
It's not the weekend.
It is my birthday.
Okay.
"Thanks, Mum."
"Hey, Ash."
Hey.
The birthday girl.
Just gonna come and  hang out for a bit.
Okay.  I wasn't doing anything.
I brought you some cake.  I know you don't eat anything.
I'm just using you as an excuse  so I can get an extra slice.
(Ash) Devious.
(Girl) Mum?
Mum!
Yeah. I'm just coming.

Hello?
Ah!
"(click, humming stops)"
Hello?
Hello?
Can you help me?
Do you know who I am?  I... I...
I can't remember who I am.
(camera clicks)
(door closes)
Hello?
Do you know who I am?
Please.
I can't remember.
None
Please help me.
Help me.
Help me please.
Help!
Help! Help me. He's  got a gun. Help me!
Hey! We have to go!
Come on.
(gun shot)
"(gun shot, air hissing)"
"(woman) Oh, my God!"
Stay back. Get back! Get back!
Get back...back...
Let me in. Let me in...  Help me. Help me!
Shit!
- There's a door round there.  - It's locked.
- You don't know that!  - There's a keypad.
We should try it.
"Get down. Anyone stands up,  he'll shoot their heads off."
He's trying to kill me!  What's going...
Shut up!  I'm trying to think.
He can see you.  Get back.
"Oh, my God!  What's wrong with those people?"
Why aren't they helping us?  They're just watching...
- Where the fuck have You been?  - What?
Get that extinguisher.
I can't!  I can't do it!
Get it now!
Ok... Ok... Ok... Ok... Ok...
Come on!
Quickly! Roll it to me!
"Damien, if he climbs   through, you grab him and"
"you grab his gun, if you can."
- I can't!  - You can!
- He'll shoot me!  - You have to!
I'm gonna smash the lock  off that door.
You help him with Gun Guy.
"He can't shoot all of us.  If he fires, he has to reload."
"We have to rush him or run, Ok?"
- I can't do this!  - We have no choice!
Help him.
(growls)
Damien!
Get him!
(grunting)
(gun shot)
Get down.
Shh.
Fuck!
Shh.
"We have to go, come on."
Shit.
Stay down.
Shit.
Stay down.
Who are they?  Why do they look like that?
They like scaring people.
What?
Okay.
We have to run for that opening.
They'll see us.
"If they're busy with him,  we can lose the hunters. Okay?"
No.
You just stay with me. Okay?
Ready... Come on...
Wait.
Wait.
The onlookers sometimes  wait in the windows.
Keep a lookout.
I'm pretty sure that's  how they find us.
Through the cameras somehow.
Onlookers spot you and a few  minutes later
the scary bastards  turn up.
"This is mad, this is just mad."
"Look, you have to hold it  together and do what I say"
or you'll get us both killed.
I woke up in this house. I don't  even know if it was my house.
I don't even  know who I am.
You must know something.
I think this is my daughter.
But you don't know?
She could be anywhere.
"Maybe you tried to kill  yourself, would that explain it?"
There was pills.
I don't blame you.
Lots have tried that fun fork  in the road since it started.
Since what started?
You really don't know?
No.
"There was a signal, like  pictures, flashing pictures."
"They just appeared on every TV,  every computer,"
anything with a screen.
I saw it.
I saw it.
Look out.
They did something to people.
Like almost everybody just  became onlookers:
"started watching,  filming stuff,"
like spectators who don't  give a shit about what happens.
That's like nine out  of ten people now.
But not us.
"Some of us weren't  affected, I don't know why."
Like that man with the  gun and that woman.
"I call them ""hunters""."
You might've noticed  that's what they do.
"They seemed normal to begin  with, but then they realise they"
"could do what they wanted --  they started taking stuff,"
"nicking cars 'cause they could,  doing what they like -"
"and not just with  things, with people."
It got worse and worse.  Now they've got an audience.
"So this, this,  this thing on the TV--"
The signal--
"That's, that's  what's doing it."
That's what's making  them act like this?
"I guess they were always  like that, underneath."
"Just needed the rules to change,  for no one to intervene."
What we gonna do?  What we gonna do?
"""Do"" do nothing; we get out."
"Where's ""out""?"
We're here.
We need to head south of here.
"They've knocked the transmitters  out, it's okay there."
"The TV transmitters, they  carry it. There's only one"
between us and the safe zone  and were gonna knock it out.
"See, it's here.  White Bear."
What?
White Bear.
(Little Girl) A picnic  with my two best friends.
(gasping)
"Jesus, what is it with you?"
"White Bear, you  said White Bear."
So?
"Look whatever's wrong with you,  you have to get it together."
Listen to me.
Don't go out there.
What's your problem? Huh?
You want something to look at?
'Cause I'll give you  something to look at.
We have got to get out of here.
I want to talk to them.  I want to talk to you.
Argh!
"Not so funny now, is it?"
(electricity crackling)
Put it down.
I just want to see what  they're looking at.
I said put it down.
"It's dangerous. Their  phones, they're dangerous."
"It's the signal, the images are  on them, they're on the screen."
What?
Don't look at it!  Don't look at it!
(woman) Jemima.
"No, no, this is all wrong!  This is all wrong!"
They're coming. Run! Run!
(vehicle accelerating)
"Get in, get in.  Come on."
Come on.
No.
"Come on! Now,  they're coming. Quick."
"Come on.  Hurry up, get in!"
(whirring appliances)
(squealing tires)
You nearly killed  us back there.
"Yeah, well I wasn't expecting  you to be there was I?"
I just saved your lives.  Like a wee thank you
you would be nice. I should  have just run yous over.
Who are you?
Who are you?
"It's not a hard question, is it?"
I know... I know you.
Do you? Well where did  we meet if you know me?
"No. Didn't think so, yeah."
"She's confused, she's  not in a good way."
"Yeah, I'll say."
So what are yous doing  out here anyway?
Heading south.
"Yeah, that's not a good move.  It's all blocked up down there."
"There's a transmitter there,  if we can knock it out..."
"I don't think you understand.  When I said it's ""not"
"a good move"" that means I'm  not driving you down there."
I know a safe place we can go.
The woods.
Your safe place is in the woods.
How'd you know that?
"I don't, I don't know."
"Christ, maybe you do know me?"
"Yeah, we pull up and we get out."
We talk.  There's no one chasing us.
Mystic Meg.
And then what happens?
We eat.
None
Told you. No bars.
They'll never find us here.
That your daughter?
"- Yeah, I think so.  - Where is she?"
I don't know.
What'd you do to your wrists?
I don't know.
Mystery mental illness?
"Yeah, I bet you do.  Lay money on it."
- What about you?  - What about me?
"Mental illness, weaknesses?"
Everyone's got weaknesses.
"Yeah, you two have got  more that most I'd say."
"That's why you're on the  receiving end, you see."
Vulnerable.
Receiving end of what?
This. Everything that's  going on. Easy pickings.
What's your weaknesses then?
My weaknesses? Show you if  you want. You wanna see it?
"Wait there, don't move."
You're gonna like this.  Not a lot.
This better not be naturism.
"Yeah, in your dreams."
Tada! Run and I'll  shoot you in the back.
"Right, come over here."
Stand there.
"You. Here, put this on."
"Put it on, backwards,  so it covers your eyes."
Put your hands on her shoulders.
Keep them there.
"You're her eyes now, alright?"
"And that is a shotgun, okay?"
If I pull this trigger it's  gonna cut yous both in half.
"So no funny business, alright?"
"Right, off you go.  Straight ahead."
Keep going through the trees.
"Come on, pick up the pace."
Got a lovely playground  for you down there.
"That's it, through here."
"That's it, straight ahead."
Grab her!
"Right, now take  her balaclava off."
Get down there.
"Oh, fuck."
Come on.
Head towards that ladder.
Get down there.
"Right, stop."
Get on your knees both of yous.  Give me that bag.
That fucking bag.
"You, get down."
Stop winging.
(sobbing)
Stop fucking crying.  Stop it.
- (cell phone)  - Eurghhhh.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm down in  that woods spot."
I'll just lash 'em to a tree  or summit like that you know.
"Just hurry up,  and get down here."
I want to get started.  it's gonna piss... Fuck!
(gun shot)
Your mate's fucked off.
"You're in double trouble  now, missus."
"Get up on that log.  Now, move."
Get your hands through there.  Get your hands through there.
Right through.  Push your arms up.
Push them.  Get them up there.
We're gonna put a show on  for these guys today.
(laughs)
"Let's see what daddy's  got in the bag, shall we?"
"Oh, Mama..."
Help me! Help me!
Why are you doing this to me?
Whoa ha! Oh yes!
"Help me, please!  I'm a human being!"
(man) They're not gonna  help you. They're gonna watch.
"What I'm going to  do here, darling,"
I'm just gonna push this  straight through your--
"Help me, please."
(gun cocks)
Thank you... Thank you...
- For What?  - For coming back For me.
I came back for this.
There's more like  him on the way.
Come on.
White Bear's not far from here;   if we step on it we might be
able to shut it down  before they get us.
What happens if we  can't shut it down?
We can.
"How? Do we hack  into it, or something?"
We don't hack anything.  We burn the control room down.
"It's not hard, we just slosh  a load of petrol round it,"
"strike a light and, fucks  the electrics or something."
Here.
In the bag.
It's the plans for the  transmitter compound.
"I've been planning  this, you know."
"Jemima?  Lie down for me, darling."
"Go on. It's a game.  Yeah, just like what teddy does."
"Lie down for me, darling."
(screams)
- Turn around!  - What?
"White Bear,  there's something not right"
about White Bear.  I remember now.
"You ""remembered""  the woods too..."
Sorry if I don't  trust your hunches.
Okay. Looks clear.
Okay.
He was good for   something after all.
"Hurry up, we need to go."
"Come on, get out."
Come with me.
A picnic with my  two best friends.
Come on.
This way.
"Oh, shit."
They'll be here any minute.  Give me the plan.
The transmitter  tower's over there.
And the cabling runs  underground into that building.
Come on.
Thought so.
(grunting)
Let's go.
Get back.
Or everything goes up.  I mean it. Stay back.
Stay back.
(saw starts whirring)
Argh!!
Argh!!!
"(applause, cheering)"
Thank you.
So.
I guess you're wondering  why you're here?
It's time to tell  you who you are.
You've looked better.
(laughter)
Do you recognise him?
Huh...Yes.
"Your fianc, Iain Rannoch."
Or should I say was your fianc.
In case you haven't guessed the  pair of you aren't very popular.
But I'll tell you  what you are though.
You're famous.
(man) The trial  of Victoria Skillane finally
"concluded today,  the verdict guilty."
Together with her fianc Iain  Rannoch whose death in custody
had delayed the trial Skillane  abducted 6-year-old  Jemima Sykes
"just miles from her home,  prompting a nationwide search"
amidst emotional pleas  from her parents.
For months the youngster's  disappearance had been a
"mystery, the sole clue  being her distinctive  white teddy bear,"
discovered in a lay-by two  miles from the family home.
The white bear became an  enduring symbol in the hunt for
"Jemima, a hunt that  ended in a local forest."
Jemima's body was found here.
It had been wrapped in a  sleeping bag and burned.
The couple were caught   after harrowing
footage of Jemima's torture  and murder was discovered on
a mobile phone in  Skillane's possession.
"Iain Rannoch identified by his  distinctive tattoo, killed the"
youngster as Victoria Skillane  held the camera.
"Breaking down in  tears, Skillane admitted to  filming Jemima's"
"final moments, claiming her  fianc had pressured her into"
"helping him maintaining  she was ""under his spell""."
The jury was not convinced by  Skillane's story
"and neither  was the judge,"
who labelled her a uniquely  wicked and poisonous  individual.
"""You were an  enthusiastic spectator to"
Jemima's suffering. You  actively revelled in her
"anguish"" he said...adding  her punishment would be"
proportionate and considered.  By hanging himself in his
"cell, many believe  Iain Rannoch evaded justice."
The public mood is  now focused on ensuring his
"accomplice can't do the  same. Patrick Lacey, UKN."
(wailing)
"Oh, don't start crying."
Crocodile tears  are making me sick!
(booing)
(audience) Murderer! Murderer!
There were no tears when you  watched him do what he did.
You filmed what he did.
A poor wee girl.
"Helpless and terrified,  and you just watched."
How do you like it now?
How do you like it!
(man) Murderer!
(audience)  Murderer! Murderer!
Get her out of here.
Throw her back to  where she came from.
(booing)
"No, don't!  Help me!"
"(man) Good evening, citizens."
Thank you so much  for coming tonight.
"Okay, we are at the  climax of our day."
"Take as many photographs as you  want, take as many photographs"
"as you can, but most importantly  what I need from you is to shout"
and scream and let that bitch  know that you are out here.
Let's get this show on the road.
(woman) Murdering bitch.
Murderer.
Evil witch.
(man) Dirty whore.
(woman) Bitch.
Burn the bitch.
Murderer!
Burn in hell!
(splat)
(cameras clicking)
Kill me.
Please just kill me.
Please.
That's what you always say.
"You've had a bad day  but this will wipe it clean,"
get you in the  mood to start again.
"No, please! No, get off me!"
What are you doing!
Takes about 30 minutes...
... for it to fully  do the business.
So while it does...
...why don't we watch some  in-flight entertainment?
Please no.
(Jemima) Healthy  stuff like apples.
Please stop.
You should enjoy this.
You shot it.
A picnic for me and  my two best friends.
(beeping)
(screams)
Help me!
"(Jem) Okay, everyone, we're  about to head into the park"
so I'll hand you  over to Baxter.
(applause)
"Thank you. All of our  roles are very,"
"very important, yours included.  Now yours come with some"
"basic rules: Rule number one  ""No Talking,"" not just to her,"
"but each other as well.  Okay, unless it's essential."
What we're trying to do  is get her to believe that
you are all mesmerised.
(laughter)
"I know, I know, I know but  she's believed it up to now."
"Morning, ticket please."
Thank you.
"(Jem) Okay, rule number two:  Keep your distance."
"I can't stress the importance  of this one enough, okay."
"Don't forget, she's a  dangerous individual."
Imagine that she's  an escaped lion.
Now yesterday she  threw a projectile.
"And we will step in if  she gets too close, we're all"
equipped with Tasers but then  we're into story shutdown and
we've all wasted a day. So  it's best to keep your distance
at least three metres back.  You can use your camera zoom.
"Last but not least,  enjoy yourself. That's probably"
"the most important rule of all,  okay? Take lots of photographs"
run around through the woods  but try and stay safe.
We'll be keeping an eye  on you making sure you're
"all okay, so get out  there, enjoy yourselves and"
"let's make this show  happen, people. Come on!"
"Look, there she is."
(Jem) Don't know yet.  I'm kind of knackered.
"Me, too."
(Baxter) She's just leaving her  house now... two minutes tops.
Right you are.
We're on.
(whistling)
Watch out!
He's trying to fucking  kill me. What's going on?
(Jem) Get that extinguisher.
"It's okay, they've gone."
"Convincing, eh?"
(whistles)
Right you are. Two minutes.
Help!
Help me!
Early screamer.  It's an early screamer tonight.
So keep the noise  up and let's go!
None
None
(door opens)
(clears throat)
They're ready for you now.
Gwendolyn Harris. We've met.
Bournemouth.
But you don't know the others.
"No, but I'm familiar with you."
Why do you want to be an MP?
Because I'm not satisfied  with the way things are.
"And rather than  sit back and moan,"
I'd prefer to do  something about it.
(man) Go again from the start.
Ok. I don't know why anyone's  surprised the world's
number one teen idol's  become a Scientologist.
Speed up the autocue please.
Popstars do believe  in weird things.
Abba believed in angels.  R Kelly believed he could fly.
They said show you this.
- This happen just now?  - Mm-hm.
Gladwell?
"""Shamed Tory Jason  Gladwell resigns capitals -"
"over Twitter porn pic scandal."""
"Oh, so he wasn't  hacked after all."
"""Originally claimed his  account had been hacked."
Resignation statement admits  'inappropriate correspondence'
with a 15-year-old girl.
"What's he tweeting dick photos  as ""correspondence"" now is it?"
"""Departure triggers a  by-election in his Stentonford"
"and Hersham constituency."""
Well you get to use  the Gladwell stuff.
Mm-hm.
Bump it all to the  top of the monologue.
Anyone seen Jamie?
(phone ringing)
(Jamie) Rach-
(Rachel) Oh. You shouldn't  be calling me any more.
You need  to sort yourself out.
I am.
Focus on Waldo.  That's going well for you.
But it's not...
"He's a hit, Jamie."
"""He"", not me, ""he""."
"Oh, just do your show."
I will...
"- (knocking on door)  - I mean, hon, if you'd just..."
(woman) Jamie.
"Jamie, hurry up."
(woman) What do you know about  Stentonford and Hersham?
"Safe Tory seat,"
so realistically I know there's  not much of a chance but...
So it's a stepping stone  for you?
Yes.
Obviously I wouldn't say  that outside of this room but...
"You want me to be honest,  there's no point in pretending."
Is there anything  in your past that
might conceivably  cause problems?
No.
Except...
I did commit a series of  murders in Huddersfield
"between '99 and 2003 but  that, apart from that..."
"Well. Thank you, Gwendolyn."
If you could leave  via that door.
Oh. That door?
We like to keep the  candidates separate.
Right. Yes.
"Idiot, idiot."
(man) Shamed supergroomer  and all round pillock of the
"community Jason Gladwell  has resigned as an MP, saying"
"he could ""no longer maintain  his position"": that position"
"presumably being ""hunched over,  wanking madly at schoolkids""."
(laughter)
- you ready?  - Uh-huh.
...how old the girl wasn't.
That's the sort of  feeble excuse
only a naive  schoolkid could swallow.
Which presumably was the idea.
Anyway the bad news is  he's resigned in disgrace.
The good news is he's now  free to pursue a full-time
career in the disgraced  paedophile industry.
(laughter)
Personally I don't understand  why anyone's surprised the...
"Um, small change  to the intro."
- What?   - Nothing huge.
Conor wanted the Jacko gag  for the monologue...
That was my bit.
"There's the Chancellor stuff,  you could use that."
"- Bit ""politics"".  - You can do politics."
I do piss taking.
Go be Waldo.
"Yes, commander."
(Conor) R Kelly  believed he could fly.
And Michael Jackson believed  that his doctor was qualified.
Big. Bold. Blue. Bear. Bollocks.
And now it's time for our  final visit to the world of
educational children's  programming courtesy of
everyone's favourite and only  occasionally inappropriate
"cool kids TV character, Waldo."
(applause)
"Whose mum's in  tonight, apparently."
"Waldo, who have you had  in your cave this week?"
"Well, Conor.  In my big pink cave this week"
I had former minister  for culture Liam Monroe.
He's quite handsome isn't he?
I was hoping he'd nosh me off.
Wanna see how it panned out?
I think we should.
Run VT!
"Hey, everybody.  It's Waldo time. Yaaayy!"
Cool! Cool! Waldoriffic!
"Hey, kids. My guest this  week is Mister Monroe."
"Hello, Mister Monroe."
"Hello, Waldo."
"Mister Monroe is a  ""politician."""
Po-li-ti-shann.
"So what is a  politician, Mr Monroe?"
Well a politician is  someone who tries to make
the world a fairer place.
Like Batman?
Not exactly like Batman.
Do you beat people up?
"No, I don't beat people up."
Are you a pussy then?
"Well, I'm not sure I know  exactly what you..."
You don't know what pussy is?
(laughter)
"Okay, clearly this  is some kind of joke."
"No joke, sorry, let's move on.  Friends again?"
(kissing sounds)
"Hello, mate. Great show."
Good. Yeah.
"(Jack) Well done, really good.  So uhm, we'll bring him over."
"You go and get him,  I'll explain about..."
Jamie.
"What you want,  Miss Tamsin?"
"Behind me, man in glasses,  talking to Jack Napier."
Jack freaks me out.
"Yeah, ditto, but he owns  the company,"
and the man he's  with is important
and wants to talk to you.
He's from the channel.
Go on.
"(Jack) Honestly what,  all I'm saying is -"
(Jim) Is he shy?
(Jack) No all's I'm saying  is he's a terrific guy -
"Jim, Jamie.  Jamie, Jim."
How do you do?
"Jim, Jack James -"
Jamie.
Jim was just talking  about Waldo.
Yeah. Liam Monroe  has lodged a complaint.
Toys out of the pram.
And that's...
Good press.
"So tough to get a  breakthrough these days,"
"but when it does,  well, it's just fantastic."
"It's fantastic the way Waldo  puts the piss up Monroe,"
"you know all those twats,  its punk, it's- it's--"
(Conor) Jack.
Excuse me.
"Well, Twitter can't  get enough of Waldo."
Loves him.
"Look, I know this show is  coming back again next year"
but we want  to see more of Waldo.
They want to do a pilot.
A Waldo pilot?
Yeah. I mean how  does that sound?
"Yeah, that sounds good."
"Sounds Storming Norman,  Fucking Storming."
Gonna give it to 'em!
(cell beep)
"(man) Yeah but look, we  can't do sketches without Waldo,"
"it's a Waldo pilot,  it's a Waldo show,"
"it's gotta be  Waldo, Waldo, Waldo."
Realistically there isn't the  budget for other animations.
"I mean live action,  other characters I can do."
What about The Brown Knight?
"What, the ""Crap Crusader""?"
(woman) We can look  into the Brown Knight.
"But right now, let's,  let's find more Waldo ideas."
(cell phone rings)
(Jamie) The problem is any  guests we book will be in on it.
"They know that Waldo's a  joke, the surprise has gone."
"Yeah, So we think round that."
"Hey, boys and girls,  it's Waldo Time!"
Yeahhhhh!
"He's awesome, isn't he?"
"I mean, look."
"Sod ""name in lights"",  you're an app now my brother."
"Alright, Sara. How's the think  tanking going? Good shit?"
"Yeah, yeah.  We're making headway."
Good. I see our friend   Monroe is in the news again.
Running in the  Stentonford by-election.
We should get Waldo down there.
"Hey. That's not a bad  idea, actually."
We get a van...
"right, with a screen with  the image of Waldo on the side."
Like it.
"And then when Monroe's  doing a meet-and-greet,"
we just turn up and  just get under his skin.
I love that.  I love it.
"- I've done Monroe.  - But, It was a great bit."
I'm dumb or clever enough  to be political. I just...
Why don't we get Waldo  to stand for the by-election?
Get people to vote for him?
He's not real.
But people have stood  as fictional characters before?
Do you think Screaming Lord  Sutch was his real name?
"We just put ""commonly  known as"" on the ballot."
"No one's actually going to vote  for him, that's not the point."
The point is we get  to hang around.
We're there for the count.
"Well, go on then, Sara.  Whack it up there."
None
(woman) He's with   a mum and baby group.
"Okay. Going live in  five, four, three, two."
(Liam) Thank you so much for  joining me this morning.
It's been incredibly informative  and I think we should
have a little round of  applause for the children.
"Who were fantastic.  Thank you, Naomi."
Thank you for your time.
"Hey! Hey, it's me Waldo."
"Oh, I like your trainers,  man."
I'd wear trainers myself
but I can't 'cause I haven't  got feet. I've got stumps.
(laughter)
He's out.
"Hey, Mister Monroe!  Mister Monroe. Hey!"
Did you get off with  any of the mums?
Where'd you look while  they were breastfeeding?
"They got big milky  tits, Mr Monroe."
"He said it! Mister Monroe,  don't walk away from me."
"I'm sorry about this, Liam."
"Hey, I'm being snubbed.  Hey, don't ignore me."
Don't just get in your car.
"It's a death trap  anyway, look at it."
Let's find out what we can about  the idiot inside that thing.
(man) Sure.
(Waldo) Mr Monroe. Oi!
(woman)  Stentonford labour party.
"Right, you've got  a choice of styles,"
"so just choose one from there,  then you put your name in there."
This is like bloody Moonpig.
(man) Don't knock  the free mail-out.
Bet Liam Monroe doesn't use  some Fisher Price leaflet app.
He doesn't have to.
Day one of the campaign  in Stentonford and Hersham.
And Tory hopeful Liam Monroe  hits the ground running.
The licence fee is something  that's very close to my
heart and I suspect...
(Waldo) Mister Monroe!  Look at me Mister Monroe!
"Hey, over here! Hey, over here.  Look over here, Mister Monroe."
(Liam) The conservative  party have been er-- have
been arguing for a reduction  of the licence fee for...
"Good morning, everybody. Why  you ignoring me, Mister Monroe?"
Why you ignoring me?  Mister Monroe?
Mister Monroe?  Why you ignoring me?
"Mum with a pushchair,  drag her into it."
"Hey, you. Mum with the  pushchair. Yeah, you."
Ask Mr Monroe why  he's ignoring me.
Why are you ignoring Waldo?
"Mr. Monroe, what's  Waldo done to you?"
We should probably just shift  before this turns stupid.
I'm not walking away  from a cartoon.
I'm not ignoring you.
"Yeah, you were, you upset  me. You made Waldo sad."
Wah.
"Well, obviously I'm absolutely  devastated that you're upset!"
Wah!
Let him get a word in.
"I'm not ignoring ""you""  because there is no ""you."""
"You are an image  voiced by a comedian,"
an alleged comedian  more accurately.
"If I'm not real,  why you talking to him?"
And by him I mean me.  Nobber.
Right.
There's no point in attempting  to converse with a cartoon.
"Oooh, ""converse"", your  lordship; thy flowery language"
doth give me a right  throbbing bone-on.
Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh.
Finished.
Drink?
I've got emails.
You know that's  Gwendolyn Harris?
The Labour candidate.
Did you read my  background doc?
Yes.
Why don't you read it tonight?  Alone.
"I'll swing by about nine,  so have your breakfast first."
Are you my dad?
Apparently not.
See you tomorrow.
(TV reporter) Today in the  Stentonford by-election.
Waldo the bear left  Monroe in stunned silence.
The colourful Waldo  launched his own campaign in
typically loud and   crowd-pleasing style.
Someone's bold?  Do I know you?
Nice way to greet a voter.
"Sorry, I thought..."
"Actually, I'm more of a rival."
"""Hey Mister Monroe,  Mister Monroe."
"Why are you ignoring me,  Mister Monroe""."
You're good at that.
"Because I am ""that""."
What? You're that thing?
"Waldo's not a ""thing"".  He's a bear."
Liam Monroe calls him worse.
"Nice work there, by the way."
"Yeah, well. It's dick jokes  at his expense basically."
Another one?
Okay. One.
"The way you describe it,"
it's like you're  doing this for a showreel.
"No, but..."
Like this place  is the equivalent of a  walk-on in a sketch show.
Shhh!
But your party  leader has to show up  because it's a mid-thing-
Midterm by-election.
Terminology tits.
You are twelve.
"So because leaderballs is there,  suddenly it's walk-on"
in a Ricky Gervais sketch  show so it's good exposure.
"You're not gonna win, you  know you're not gonna win."
"Come on, shhh."
You're not gonna win though.
Of course not.
"So why not be honest?  Say ""You arseholes aren't going"
"to vote for me, so here's  what I think anyway."""
It doesn't work like that.
"Nothing does, that's why  everything's bollocksed."
You're angry for someone  who's doing well.
I'm the voice of a blue bear.
"If that's doing well,  then we are doomed."
I can't see.
"(Jamie) Hang on,  there's a thing."
Have you had a fox in here or  do you live like a 14-year-old?
"Don't get too excited,  I'm not sleeping in it."
"Shit, really?"
(loud moaning)
You're amazing.
Sorry?
You're amazing?
Ha! Thank you.
(sighs)
What's up?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
It's just...
I haven't been  happy in a while
"and this is good, you know."
Mm.
Can I have your number?
Yes.
None
Where's our mark this morning?
We're out on the road.
Ooh. Bien sur.
Hello. I'm Mister Monroe.
Vote for me and  keep things shitty.
(laughs)
(cell beep)
Vote Waldo. Vote Waldo.
Vote Waldo. Vote Waldo.
(Gwendolyn)  You're right. Strong Tory.
I warned you.
You know you're on Monroe turf  when they live so far apart.
(horn honks)
(man) I'm voting Waldo!
I met Waldo last night.
"Jamie, the guy who plays him.  He's fun."
Fun?
Mmm-hmm.
Did you tell him anything  about our campaign?
Not really.
Not really or no?
Not really.
"Look, he's okay."
He's a comedian.
"He's mocking Monroe  now, it'll be you next."
His act is all f-this  and penis jokes.
- But...  - Don't see him again.
Okay. Job done  till the husting tomorrow.
Some media students doing  a Question Time type thing;
they've asked Waldo  to join the panel.
"Oh, come on. It's my nightmare,  going on Question Time."
"It's students, you'll walk it."
I can't answer  serious questions!
No one wants you to!
"You're the comic  relief, lighten up."
Just have a look. I'm sure  you'll find lots in there.
(cell rings)
(Roy) Are there any issues  you're concerned about at all?
(ringing stops)
(disconnect tone)
Hey.
"Oh, hi."
I thought we were going to...
Sorry I've had a tough day.
Right. Not even one?
Sorry.
"Well, what about tomorrow?"
"Look, I can't. When this is  happening, I can't see you."
- What do you mean?  - I'm sorry.
Do they think that  looks like Question Time?
Yeah.  It looks politicsy.
Check the host.  Jailbait Dembleby.
When it comes  to addiction and addicts
"we should sympathise,  but we shouldn't patronise."
"You know serious drug  use is a criminal offence,"
that is committed  voluntarily and for pleasure.
"Look, I'm sorry,  these are the facts."
"Waldo, what do you think?"
"Mister Monroe,  are you addicted?"
No.
"Sorry I mean  ""Are you a dickhead?"""
(laughter)
I think we have to ask  ourselves...
I think we have to ask ourselves
"""What is this for""?  And ""Why do we waste our time"
with animated trivialities  like him? I mean why?
Why?
I mean why? I mean why? I mean  why? I mean why? I mean why?
"This is just the kind of thing,  rather than see you laugh..."
"They laugh at you, Limbo."
"You laugh, you're laughing  at someone who won't engage."
"Who is scared to engage,"
who hides behind  a children's cartoon.
"Who you calling a  kiddy toon, fool?"
"I'm, I'm, I'm speaking  about James Salter."
"- That's your name, isn't it?  - Don't worry about it."
"James Salter, this is the  man who's behind all this."
"He's 33 years old, a man whose  career can be summed up"
surprisingly quickly: you were  in a sketch troupe that enjoyed
"minor success about six years  ago and the, the others moved"
"on to better things, but your  main achievement seems to have"
"been playing the, the part of  a corn-on-the-cob in a high"
interest personal loan  commercial.
"I notice you're,  you keep that pretty quiet."
"And now of  course operating this,"
this sort of teddy bear thing.
Which by the way is  easier than it looks.
"Anyone could do it.  See this is, this is the thing."
"It's easy, what he does."
He mocks.
"And when he can't think of  an authentic joke, which is"
"actually quite often,  he just swears."
I think that this puppet's  inclusion on this panel debases
"the process of debate, and  smothers any meaningful"
discussion of the issues.
"So I return to  my original question,"
is that really what this is for?
He has nothing to offer  and he has nothing to say.
"Prove me wrong.  Huh? Speak, Waldo."
Please.
Come on. Speak up.
"There you see, nothing."
"Aw, go fuck yourself."
(laughter)
There. More swearing.
You're a joke.  You look less human than I do
and I'm a made-up bear  with a turquoise cock.
(laughter)
What are you? You're just an  old attitude with new hair.
Assuming you're my  superior because I'm not  taking you seriously?
"No one takes you seriously,  that's why no one votes."
- The vast majority do vote.  - Bullshit.
Surely this is enough?
You think you deserve respect?
"Well, just common courtesy."
Because you went  to public school and
grew up believing you're  entitled to everything?
Ad hominem nonsense.
Gwendolyn Harris we...
Something's got to change.
No one trusts you lot  'cause they know
you don't give a shit about  anything outside your bubble.
"What about your mate Gladwell,  the kiddy-flasher, you knew"
"him for 20 years, did you  not know what he was like?"
"No, of course not."
"Yeah, 'cause you're  all just front, like him,"
"sly and pretending, and in  that way you're all the same."
"Gwendolyn Harris, is all  of politics a waste of time?"
"Well, of course I think no."
"Oh, shut up.  You're worse."
"Seriously, she's  faker than him."
For once I find myself  agreeing with Liam Monroe in
"that this really doesn't  get us anywhere, and there's"
not much point  in us continuing to...
Why are you here?  Tell them why you're here.
Tell them why you're here.  Tell them why you're here.
"She's here to build a showreel.  I'm not kidding,"
"that's literally it.  Knows she's not going to win,"
"this is all experience,  to get herself on telly."
She actually gives less of a  shit about anyone round here
than he does because he'll  actually have to represent you.
Am I wrong?
"A career politician, someone  else less real than me,"
and I can do this.
(laughter)
Can I just make  a couple of points...
"Oh, shut up, you pebble."
What is this for?  Is that what you wanted to know?
"And the truth is, none of us  know any more thanks to you."
What are you for?  What are you for?
Thank you and goodnight.
(loud panting)
None
(knocks on door)
(Tamsin) Jamie.
Jamie?
Jack says he wants to see us.
You can't avoid it.
Get dressed.  He'll meet us outside.
"(Reporter) And yet accusations  of vapidity aside, it's clearly"
"tapped a nerve: in just three  days, Waldo has gone viral."
The video of his clash has  already been viewed over a
million times on YouTube.
There are Facebook  groups calling on
Waldo to form a national party.
(Waldo) You're a joke.  You look less human than I do
and I'm a made-up bear  with a turquoise--
What are you? You're just  an old attitude with new hair.
Assuming you're  my superior because I'm
not taking you seriously?  No one takes you seriously.
"Oh, look here he is,  the man of the moment!"
How does it feel  to be a phenomenon?
(Jamie) Shitifying.
"You are everywhere,  my son."
"Twitter, the news,  have you seen the poll?"
"You're in third place, mate.  You overtook that Lib Dem prick."
"Yeah, well, he's  a glass of water."
"This is an opportunity, Jamie."
He knows my name now.
(Jack) We could really   do something here.
You know everyone's  pissed with the
"status quo, and Waldo  gives that a voice."
"Waldo's a bear, a blue bear."
"Tell him, Tams."
We've been asked on Consensus.
It's a ten minute  one-to-one interview
"- with Phillip Crane.  - ""Pitbull Crane""?"
Big guns for big guns.
"Hello? I'm not a  politician, okay?"
I don't want to be a politician.
(Jack) We know that  you hate politics.
"I don't hate them, I'm just  not interested in them."
You don't need to be  interested in them.
You just need to be Waldo.
And when Crane asks  something tricky and
I look stupid because I  don't know how to answer?
You'll know the answer.  Because you have a producer.
"Look, I can tell you  what to say."
"I can live-google any facts,"
"give you stats, quotes,  whatever else you need."
So you've got a safety net  for the concrete stuff
and the rest is Waldo and you  can do that in your sleep.
You'll piss all over Crane.
"He'll know there's a team  around me, he'll see it."
"Yeah, good. I hope he does.  I hope he points a camera at it."
"All the other MPs have  got teams, we're just"
more honest about it. Now  come on. What d'you say? Ey?
Jamie. Jamie!
Why would  I want to do this?
Look the world is knackered and  you can do something about it.
I don't know what  you're on about.
"Waldo has got the attention  of the young, and the young"
don't give a shit about  anything except trainers  and pirating films.
Do you have any other astounding   theories about young people?
"Yeah, yeah, I do actually.  Look, they care about Waldo,"
they'll vote for Waldo. The  video was a hit for a reason...
The video's embarrassing.  I'm embarrassed by it.
I was lashing out.  I wasn't even articulate -
It doesn't matter-
Or funny which  is almost worse.
We can build on that.
Waldo's not real.
"Exactly! That's what you  said that really hit home,"
"he's not real, but he's  realer than all the others."
He doesn't stand for anything.
"Yeah well at least he doesn't  pretend to. Look we, we don't"
"need politicians, we've all got  iPhones and computers right?"
"So any decision that has to  be made, any policy we just"
"put it online. Let the  people vote thumbs up,"
"thumbs down, the majority  wins. That's a democracy."
"That's a, that's an  actual democracy."
So's YouTube and I don't know  if you've seen it but the most
popular video is a dog farting  the theme tune to Happy Days.
"Well, today it's Waldo."
No. It's still the dog.
"Listen, can you imagine  all the things we can change"
if we fucked the  politicians out the equation.
I've said what I've said  and now I'm shutting this door.
"Do you know who owns Waldo?  I do, I own the rights."
He's my character.
"Yeah, written  for my show."
You're too frightened to  take to the next level.
Fine. I understand.  But also: fuck off.
And watch me fly.
"You own Waldo,  you can't be Waldo."
"(Waldo voice) Eh Jamie,  Jamie. What's happening?"
Pretty close I'd say.
"What's happening?  Ahh, Waldorific yeahh, yeahhh."
Why's it going of left a bit?
Because the...
I know I've got my...
Put your thumb  in the white thing -
I got that in there. Okay.
That's not how that works.
"First tonight,  a figure, or more accurately"
a character who's been  causing an upset in the
Stentonford by-election.  Unlike the other candidates
he has no party affiliation.  He doesn't even have a surname.
"He is Waldo, a few weeks ago  just a cult character in a"
"comedy show, today, an official   mascot for protest voters ."
Vote Waldo.
Cartoons don't play by the  rules and Waldo's open disdain
for his opponents has  clearly struck a chord.
"Waldo, as a mascot for the  disenfranchised aren't you"
ultimately neutralizing  seriously effective dissent?
"Can I have subtitles  for Mr Crane, please?"
"By encouraging people not to  care, you're actively dangerous."
"Dangerous, you think the  public can't be trusted?"
No.
Isn't that basically  you calling them twats?
"No, I..."
"Bellends, then?"
Did you actually come  here for a discussion or...
"You're snooty for a glorified  Punch and Judy man, Phil."
You know you're gonna get  your best ratings in months
'cause I'm here.
"To even get close  to the figures,"
"I'm gonna pull in  for you tonight,"
you'd have to fuck  a prawn sandwich live on air.
Make a nice prawn cocktail.
Yeah could we make a serious  political point that is.
"I've got one big blue  point to make, fool."
Would you like to  have a look at it?
"Great work tonight. Look at,  Look at this, look at this."
It's The Waldo polling app.  Now this can pinpoint you
with GPS so that when  you're at a polling station
"it unlocks loads  of free shit, look."
"(Waldo) Thanks  for voting, dickhead!"
"Thanks for voting, dickhead!"
(laughs) It's good isn't it?
Who's this guy we're meeting?
I dunno.  But he's from Washington
and he's got my  restricted number.
"Jeff Carter,  from the agency."
(Jack) Hey.
Hey. And I'll leap right in.
I think what you're doing  with Waldo is fascinating.
"From ""the agency""?"
"Yeah, listen, Waldo may be the  perfect political figurehead."
Waldo the bear.
The bear people like. The fact  he's a bear's an assist.
"- ""An assist""?  - It helps."
(Jeff) Right. You look  at human politicians;
"you're instinctively like  brrrr - uncanny, right?"
"Like the girls in porn you  just know something's wrong,"
'cause why else  are they doing it?
"It's usually Daddy issues, ey."
Just like politics.  Waldo bypasses that.
You already know he's not real.  So no personal flaws.
I'm a person.
"With respect, Waldo's  more than you."
"He's a team, and you're open  about that, which is fantastic."
The honesty thing works.
Waldo is a construct people  not just accept but embrace.
"At the moment  he's anti-politics,"
"which is a political stance  in itself, right?"
But he could deliver  any brand of political
"content, minus the potential  downsides of a human messenger."
"In a debate, your team could  google every word the other guy"
"says, then let Waldo hit him  with debunk stats and spit a"
Twitter-ready zinger  into the next sentence.
He's the perfect assassin.
We won't win though.
You guys are so British.
"No, of course he won't win, you  started out too coarse off the"
"bat, there's no substantial  basis to what you offer, and the"
"whole nihilist ""democracy sucks""  thing yeah is kind of wack-a-doo"
"but with a targeted, hopeful  message which we of course can"
provide. Energising the  disenfranchised without spooking
the middle via your new  platform: you got a global
political-entertainment product  people actually want.
You could roll  this out worldwide.
- Like Pringles.  - Absolutely.
It's...  It's interesting stuff though.
"When you're done  with Stentonford,"
there may be an opportunity  in South America.
Se puede hablar espaol?
Vivi en Madrid tres aos.
Excelente.
What?
He's not coming.
But he's the party leader.
It's too toxic.
(woman) Meanwhile as support  for Gwendolyn Harris appears to
"be dwindling, Labour denies  the party is losing faith"
in their young candidate but  Miss Harris spent most of the
day locked in crisis talks  at party head...
(turns TV off)
"(radio) In the Stentonford  by-election,"
Waldo the cartoon  bear continues to...
Did you see Gwendolyn  Harris yesterday?
She looks like  she's been poisoned.
Because he's gonna overtake her.
"If that thing is the main  opposition, then the"
whole system looks absurd.
Which it may well be.
But it built these roads.
(knocks on door)
"Just come in, Roy."
"I'm sorry, okay?"
It was wrong to  speak to you like that...
"After the campaign,  I would've called you."
After the campaign.
All you've done  is strengthen Monroe.
"You won't win either, but  I was at least attempting"
to represent...
"Well, I don't know, not just  bollocks to everything."
"If you were preaching  revolution, that'd be something."
But you're not because that'd  require courage and a mindset.
And what have you got?
Who are you?
What are you for?
Morning.
So final push.
"You remind everyone that's  got the app, that if they"
recommend it to friends it  unlocks a little fez for Waldo.
(Tamsin) We're here.
Attention shoppers.
I'm here to ask you an  important favour. Gather round.
Come over here and listen.
"Don't vote for me, I'm  an insult. Seriously."
"Vote for Monroe or  Harris or I dunno,"
UKIP or even that Lib Dem guy.
(woman) He's a prick!
"Seriously, only an arsehole  would actually vote for me."
"What Is this, irony?"
I'm worse than a wasted vote.
He's from the Harris campaign.
"I mean it, you idiots!  Don't vote for me!"
Don't vote for me!  Don't vote for me!
Don't vote for...
Booo!
Shut up.
"No. Don't boo him, he's right!  He's right."
- What are you doing?  - Resigning.
Jamie.
"Look! It's me, I'm Waldo."
"This guy, whoever this  guy is, he's a hero."
"You should throw stuff at  Waldo, he's bad bloody news."
- (woman) He's funny.  - He's not.
"Don't listen to that  man, he's a lesbian. Ah!"
"- (laughing)  - So remember,"
"the polls are open,  and if you've got my app,"
you can unlock new stuff like  catchphrases and a little
hat n' that. Only an idiot  wouldn't vote for me.
So question the status quo!
(Jamie) Kill it!
Kick them where it hurts!
The first man to hit him  gets five hundred quid!
"Yeah, that's right. Knock  him down. Knock him down."
"Smash it.  Yeah, Yeah. Yeah, Yeah."
Yeah.
None
"(TV) I the undersigned, being  the returning officer for the"

[electronic humming]
[high-pitched whine]
[mirror cracking]
[ice crackling]
[wind rushing]
[faint music plays]
"[ Wizzard: ""I Wish It Could  Be Christmas Every Day""]"
[pots clanking]
[turns music off]
I was just  getting into that.
What are you doing?
Roast potatoes.
- We're doing Christmas.  - Christmas.
"Christmas Day, December 25th.  You've heard of it?"
"No work today, so, uh...  the bottle's on the table."
"I know we didn't have  decorations last year.  But, uh..."
I couldn't find them  last year.
They're only supposed  to have stored essentials here.
I think it's kind of adorable  someone thinks tinsel is  essential.
I figured it'd be good for us  to have a... a meal.
A drink. Talk?
"- Good for you or me?  - Come on. What has it been,"
five years? How many sentences  have you said to me? Three?
"- [sighs]  - I mean,  I'm exaggerating... a little."
"But, come on, there is a little  bit of a conversational drought  happening here."
- My ears need water.  - I'm not big on conversation.
- Practice makes perfect.  - Maybe I'll bore you.
"Buddy, look, at this point,"
being bored by anything other  than snow would be a relief.
So come on.
Chit-chat.
"Conversate, something."
"Come on, for me."
- for Christmas.  - What do you want  to talk about?
Why are you here?
No one ends up here
without things going to total  shit for them back out there.
"It's a job, not a jail."
Often one  and the same thing.
So...
...what went wrong  for you out there?
Nothing.
Bullshit.
It's not an interrogation.
What about you?
An icebreaker.  You're learning.
- What went to shit for you?  - Sure you don't want  that drink?
Did you talk  your way into trouble?
In a roundabout way.
I talked to people.
- Made money from it.  - Why? What were you?
"Some sort of, um,  Los Angeles drive-time DJ?"
I was not a DJ.
More like a guru.
"Oh, don't say you were  a spiritual guru."
I was decidedly not  a spiritual guru.
[musical notification]
"[man] Hello, Harry.  I'm patched through now.  How are you doing?"
"[Harry] Sorry,  I'm not quite dressed yet."
"[man] Don't worry,  that's why I'm here."
Just show me what  you're planning on wearing
and we'll take things  from there.
- How about this?  - Doesn't work.
It's boring blue and you're  not boring blue. Not tonight.
All right.  Which one of these is good?
"Like I said,  white shirt with a black tie"
with a slim-cut grey jacket.
"Classic, timeless. Smart."
- I don't usually do jackets.  - You don't usually do anything.
"And sort out that hair,   because..."
OK. [exhales]
"Remember those breathing  techniques we talked about, OK?"
You're going to do fine.
It's going to be fine.
[loud music playing]
[indistinct chattering]
- She's cute.  - Yes.
Not out loud.
Absolutely.
You need to pick your spots when  you want to talk out loud. OK?
OK. The function room  is in the back.
"Trust me, if you walk  in there like you belong,"
- no one's going  to say anything.  - OK.
"So what were you running,  some corporate espionage outfit?"
Romantic services.
Boy meets girl thanks to...
...in-the-field assistance.
You coached dorks whilst  they cruised singles bars.
Singles bars are depressing.  We'd do regular bars and clubs.
But at Christmas time...
...we'd gate-crash  office parties.
"See, there's this dynamic  to Christmas work parties."
All the attractive women
have been surrounded by  regulation office ass-clowns
"for the whole year, and now they  want to let their hair down."
According to the pop  psychologist.
So I know how the mind works.
"[man] Now, don't stand  around like a lamppost."
Walk over to the bar.
Remember. Always move  with purpose.
[indistinct chattering]
"- [woman] Yeah, who's next?  - Yeah. Can I have a...?"
"Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke  and a shot of tequila."
"[scoffs] Yeah. Don't worry  about him, all right?"
Just grab one of those  empty bottles off the bar
while Captain Douchebag  orders his piss water.
We're just going to need it  for a prop anyway.
Have a look around.
See anything you like?
What? The blonde?
The dark-haired girl?
"Interesting choice. Go straight  over, but focus on the blonde."
Now. Come on.
Confidence. You can do this.
"Hold on, just finding  out who they are."
"OK, uh, bullshit opener."
"Um, try the horse story.  At the blonde girl."
[clears throat]
"Hey, so, did anyone see that guy  outside riding the horse?"
- Did you see him?  - What? A guy on A horse?
"Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago,  this guy, shirtless,"
- riding A horse  down the high street.  - Really?
"Yeah, honestly. He, uh..."
"The weirdest part was that  he had a bow and arrow, right?"
- What? A real bow and arrow?  - I swear to God.
"He probably did it for a bet  but he looked like something  out of Tolkien,"
- you know?  - [both laugh]
"- Sorry, who are you?  - [nervous chuckle]"
Stall until I...  until I find something.
I'm pretty sure I'm me.
Just you're not  from the office.
Who do you know from here?
"Say, ""I know you."" Friendly."
"I know you, for one."
"- Dawson.  - Dawson, isn't it?"
You met at Kath's barbecue.
Yeah. We met at  Kath's barbecue back in...
- June.  - ...June or so. Yeah.
He had a pork pie hat.
You had a poor guy's hat.
"A ""pork pie hat."""
A pork pie hat that  you wore on your head.
"He'll pretend he remembers,  even though"
he won't actually  know if he does.
- Right.  - Yeah?
"Yeah, sorry."
"No. No, no worries.  No worries. Crazy night."
You're doing fine.  Don't neglect the blonde.
"You, I don't know."
"- Um, Amy.  - Amy. Hi."
Get her to introduce you  to the dark-haired girl.
"[clears throat] So, uh, are all  of your friends this suspicious?"
- Nice.  - I don't think so.
- [Harry] Yeah?  - This is Jennifer.
"- Hi, Jennifer.  - Hi."
Now focus on Amy and we'll do  that funny material that we  worked on.
"Anyway, this guy gets off  the horse and he's got  a backpack, right?"
"The tactic,  generally, was to deliberately"
freeze out the one you were  actually interested in.
For one thing you  wouldn't seem needy but...
"...also they would, most times,  sort of lean in naturally."
People want to be noticed.
They don't like to be shut out.  It makes them feel invisible.
But this girl...
This girl seemed content  with being ignored.
Maybe she could  smell a loser.
No.
No. She was an outsider.
An attractive outsider.
And there's nothing more  tantalising than that.
[indistinct chatter]
- Huh.  - [Harry] Great.
"Well, she's off. OK."
Gonna be a challenge.  Don't quit.
Let's let our friend Amy here  yadder on for a little while
"and then, uh,  find an excuse to slip away."
"They will sit outside  on the balcony till,  like, four in the morning."
[Harry] Yeah?  It's startling.
"Listen, I've just go  to the, um, little boys' room."
"So, uh, just keep the party  going and I'll,"
- you know... [laughs]  - Sure.
Do you actually have to go?
"Yeah, but it's not  easy with you watching."
I promise. I won't peek.
"So you streamed everything  he saw, and he trusted you  with that?"
Well...  it was only me watching.
"Jesus, how much urine? He's  pissing like a harpooned cow."
- It's making me want to go.  - [all laughing]
"[man] Well, it is!"
"OK, there's our girl.  Um, all right, Harry."
Your best bet is to just go over  and start talking to her.
You just want  to establish a rapport.
OK? Don't be scared of her.
"OK, guys, any observations so  far, helping our man out here?"
"Here's what's interesting,  she's pretty but, uh,  no one's hitting on her."
[man 1] Probably means  they've given up.
[man 2] She always gives them  the brush-off cos...
"They're regular types, she's an  outsider with zero in common."
- OK that's a possible in.  - [exhales]
"Harry, engage in conversation,  but be cynical."
Right? Cutting.
"Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?  You two against the world."
Confidence. Confidence.  Just talk to her.
I don't really get parties.
"You know, you just kind of turn  up and it's, uh, it's enforced  fun, all night."
Talk about what TV shows  you've fallen behind on.
Pretend to be happy.  [scoffs]
"Maybe everyone else enjoys it,  maybe it's just me?"
It's definitely  not just you.
"All right, good start. Now do  some more outsider small talk."
And keep looking at her.  I need to gauge her reactions.
"So I noticed you sitting  alone on the edge and I, uh..."
"I thought,  ""Hey, kindred spirit."""
"I really hate when people say  ""kindred spirit"", you know."
And people that do that.
- Me too.  - [chuckles]
"Yeah, I guess you don't  really like parties either."
The noise wrecks it for me.
"All the talking and talking,  it never fucking stops."
"OK, she curses,  so should you."
"Shit, fucking, I fucking always  totally think that it's fucking  shit. You know?"
I can't think through  all the babble.
I only got through it last year  because I was on drugs.
[laughs]
"I'm sorry, what's that?  What's that?"
"Just, like, pills, but"
they must've been pretty strong  because I actually enjoyed  myself.
- That's cool.  - Don't say cool.
"- I wish I had some drugs  right now.   - No, you don't."
I'm just... I'm joking.
I don't take them anymore.
"- Say, ""That's good.""  - That's good,  because you don't..."
"You don't need that  shit in your system, no."
I'd say she's a level four  rock chick.
Semi-reformed. Probably respond  well to spiritual conversation.
"I don't think I can face  fucking weeks of that.  I might bail, boys."
"OK, look,  it's too public here."
"Ask if you can move someplace  quieter, where you can really  talk."
People want to be heard.  That's why 90 per cent of  seduction is just listening.
[man] Or at least pulling  a face like you're listening.
"Yeah, that works, too."
The important thing  is to make them feel important.
Like they can make you want to  extinguish the rest of the world
and focus on them.
Full attention.
Like you're not giving me now.  What's wrong?
- that clock.  - What about it?
I just... I just never  noticed it before.
[scoffs] In five years? Jesus.
"Anyway, the point is to stay  locked in on them long enough"
to build a rapport.
"So, well, I would guess  that either every guy in there"
"has already tried to hit on you  or, uh, maybe they find you too  intimidating."
"- Am I intimidating?  - No, no, no, no, no.  I'm just, uh..."
"No, I just imagine that  they all kind of want  to get in inside your..."
- Head.  - ...head.
[chuckles]  Some of them have tried.
Not directly.
"They send messages,  or they make it so you know  what they're thinking."
Yeah. That can't be fun.
"It's just tiring, you know.  It just doesn't end, ever."
"[Harry] I wouldn't know,  I never hit on anyone."
"- [Jennifer] Really?  - OK, uh..."
- Ask her how long  she's worked there.  - Um...
[Harry] How long  have you worked for...
- Magson Frank.  - ...Magson Frank.
"- Three years.  - Oh, wow.  So Three Christmas parties."
This will be my last.
"- Oh, Really? are you leaving?  - Mm-hm."
"I've been planning it forever,  but you know what it's like."
"You know you have to do it, but  when it comes right down to it,"
it's hard  to work up the courage.
You can empathize with that.
"Yeah. It's like when you want  to jump into a pool,"
and you're worried that  the water's going to be cold.
But you know moments after you  jump in that it'll be fine.
It's the fear of the shock  that holds you back.
"Ultimately, the only thing  you're worried about is  the transition"
from one state to another.
And that can't hurt you  because it's... it's just  a state change.
"Great stuff, kid.  Almost word-for-word."
"That's exactly right,  it's just a state change."
Right. And it's   frustrating because
"you've always got these ten  voices in your head saying,  ""Don't do it"""
"and another ten in your head  saying, ""Do it""."
Which one do you listen to?
"The ""do it""s."
Really?
"Yeah. If you don't like it, you  can just cut and run, you know."
Get it over and done with.
You're right. I will.
[chuckles]
Well... to changing states.
- To changing states.  - [liquid sloshing]
- [Harry laughs] Ooh!   - [Jennifer] Ooh! Sorry.
- She touched his knee.  - She touched his fucking knee!
"Gentlemen, gentlemen,  please, please."
"Harry, you're doing great.  Ask her if she would like  another drink."
"Listen, let me get you  another drink."
[chuckles] Let me think.  I just need the loo a sec.
So thanks to you some gawko  finally meets a girl.
It's not much  of a Christmas story.
I haven't finished yet.
Maybe he comes down her chimney.
[exhales]
[exhales] I just don't feel  comfortable doing this.
What?
I mean she... I like her.
- She likes you.  - It's cheating.
I'd never have even  had the nerve to talk to her.
Aren't you glad you did?
"Yeah, I... Yes. Yes.  But I just..."
"It's just a bit of a nightmare  having you, you know,"
"all of you in my head, watching  us... Telling me what to do."
I just want to talk to her  myself. And it's...
It's a bit of a head-fuck. I  kind of want you all to go away.
I don't... Hey.  [nervous chuckle]
[clears throat]
- Come back to mine.  - Sorry?
I want you  to come back to mine.
"I thought about asking you, and  a little voice said, ""Do it""."
So I'm doing it.
Um... uh...
Say yes!
I want to do this.
It's my way of saying thanks.
"- Sorry.  - no, um..."
- Hole-in-one!  - On his first run!
- His first bloody run!  - Just say yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
[door opens]
[both exhale nervously]
I don't usually bring  people back here.
"Well, I'm honoured."
- Come in.  - [man] Did you watch
when they went back to hers  and got up to whatever  they got up to.
Did you carry on watching  through his eyes?
What do you think I am?
"Clearly, I don't know."
"Maybe if you spoke  to me more, you'd know."
No. My job was done.
Of course I didn't watch.
- [Harry] Here? OK.  - [Jennifer] Mm-hm.
Nice place.  I like the mantelpiece.
And that bird.
Kooky decor.
Indicating sexual  adventurousness.
[exhales]
"- I'll get the drinks.  - Yeah, OK. I'll just sit."
"- The bedroom's that way.  - Yeah, OK."
I'll meet you in there.
"OK, Harry.  You're going to the moon."
Just sooner than expected.
- I can't... I can't do it.  - This is first-time nerves.
"It's all happening so suddenly.  I didn't expect this,  this quickly."
You just got  to roll with it.
"I don't want you  all to see, all right?"
"Oh, now he's  Mr Fucking Ethics."
Now wait.  You were happy to take
- a window seat  while others did it.  - [Harry] That was different!
I didn't hear any objections  when he watched me getting  sucked off
by that German girl.  That was a first date.
- [Harry] Look...  - Refund.
"Look, she's too real.  This is too real."
Nothing is too real.
"Yeah, but..."
"- You're standing.  - Yeah, I..."
I just didn't want  to be too presumptuous.
I need you on the bed.
[man on monitor] Jesus!
[nervous chuckle]
[both chuckle nervously]
[whispers]  They can't fucking wait.
- Oh...  - Is She going  to take that top off?
- If there's no tits.  I want a discount.  - They're gonna have sex.
You're getting the season  finale in episode one.
"Yeah, but if I don't  see her tits..."
Will you please be patient?  Jesus.
Have some respect.
[grunting]
[coughing]
Hey. Are you OK in there?
Wow. What is that?
"""Fuck them"" is what it is."
"A big glass of ""fuck them""."
Fuck... fuck who?
"Always saying what to do,  half saying one thing,  half saying another."
"The talk, the constant talk."
"- This isn't good.  - I'm not getting tits, am I?"
"I stopped taking the pills  they said I should take,"
because they dulled the sound.
"Always, they've spoken to me,"
"always there, and I've had it."
"OK, Harry, I think we should  think about wrapping this up."
"I was planning on drinking this  tonight to make them stop,  but I was wavering."
"Coward, fucking coward,"
"and then I met you,  and it was fate."
You knew what it was like  and you said do it.
"So now, we're saying  ""fuck it"" together."
- What's in the drink?  - It doesn't matter. Wrap it up.
I know you hear them too.  I saw you talking to them.
"No. They're real people,  these are real people."
There's no such thing  as real people.
"- Harry, get out of there now!  - [Harry coughing]"
"It's like a club, it's a club  where we meet girls and they  talk us through..."
"- no one understands Me, either.  - no."
"All night, they've been watching  us and there's this one guy,"
- he's the leader.  He's the leader.  - We're the same.
"They're watching us. All night,  they've been watching."
They can see you.  They can see me.
No one understands  what that's like.
"There are a hundred  who see through me,"
"standing at their government  depots,"
shouting what to think.
[Harry struggling to breathe]
Not any more.
- You too.  - I don't want it.
- It's a state change.  - I don't want it.
It's just a transition
"and soon, they won't be there  and we'll be free."
Please... Please...  I don't want it.
You do.
You do.
"Shh, shh, shh, shh..."
"- [Harry grunting frantically]  - Shh, shh, shh. You do."
She murdered him?
"A mercy killing, she'd say."
- So when Did you  find out about this?  - Hm?
"I mean, when did you know  that this had happened?"
"Uh... I saw it on a newscast,  I think."
"[Harry screaming, gurgling]"
Wipe and destroy everything. OK?  Everything. Now go.
[toy squeaks]
[toy clatters  and plays loud music]
[trash clattering]
[woman] Matthew?
What's going on?
What are you doing?
So Claire... she was my wife.
"She's British, you'd like her."
"And I'm your wife, in fact."
[Matthew] Claire found out  I was involved
and took what you might call  a dim view.
She blocked me.
You ever been blocked?
"I've had enough.  Matthew, it's done."
- Stop it. Stop.  - Not This time.
[Matthew]  It drives you crazy.
"- Why? Why?  - Once they hit  that button, that's it,"
you're locked out.  End of conversation.  You can't hear or speak to them.
They can't hear  or speak to you.
"Every time you look at them,  there's just this...  anonymous shape."
"It usually only lasts  for what, like an hour."
"But when  they leave it going,"
"oh, shit."
"Price of progress, I suppose."
[exhales deeply] We all got...
"We all got  Zed-Eyes put in, right."
Which is all fine and dandy  until something like this  happens
and then it's bullshit.
You can't  even take them out.
Packet gravy.
How British.
Merry Christmas.
Now we're festive. Huh?
To Christmas!
"Anyway, she left me,  took custody of Mel,  that's our daughter."
"Hence, stranding me  in this lovely place."
I didn't want to be  surrounded by reminders.
[door slams shut]
- What?  - Did you hear that?
Hear what?
"Well, anyway,  I'm glad we're talking."
"Silence can be oppressive.  You think weird shit  in a vacuum, huh?"
"I mean, you feel better, right?  Communicating?"
"Talking to me, finally?"
"A little bit, maybe. Yeah."
"[laughs]  Man, you are a locked box."
"I mean,  that's a good thing."
"Most people are too easy  to read, especially  if you know minds."
"Using party tricks to pick up  girls isn't ""knowing minds."""
The picking up girls thing  was a hobby.
My job  was completely different.
You'll never guess  what that was.
- Marketing person?  - no.
- Door-to-Door salesman?  - Please.
Proctologist?
- You're never going to get it.  - I'm not going to try.
All right.  Let's make it a game.
I'll describe to you...
"...my day at work, and you stop  me when you've guessed it."
[man on TV] The extreme weather  has hit sales hard this  Christmas.
Five inches of snow...
[woman thinking] That's going  to wreck my portfolio just when  I need it.
[sighs]
Don't know what  I'm going to do about that.
"Oh, God, more messages.  I'll never clear this inbox."
Sorry.  Constant bloody admin.
Just time  for a little snack.
I can eat  before an operation?
Wonders of modern science.
"Oh, thank God.  I'm starving."
[woman thinking]  That toast looks burnt.
Should I say something?
"Yeah, I think  I'll say something."
All good?
"To be honest, it's not quite how  I like it. It's a bit overdone."
Sorry.
I'll make some more.
Bet she hates me now.
How long  is this going to take?
"Hi, I'm Madge.  I'm your anaesthetist today."
Hi.
"[woman thinking] God, she's  young. Hope she's qualified."
"OK, enough. Stop thinking about  things that could go wrong."
They said it's straightforward  and painless. I'm just going  to relax.
"OK, Greta, just relax.  Here we go."
"[Madge] Now, just count  backwards from ten."
"Ten, nine,  eight, seven, six..."
"- ...five...  - [Greta thinking]  Five, four, three,"
"two, one."
"Um, I can't...  I can't see."
"Um, where am I?"
"- Uh, what's that noise?  - [drill whirring]"
"- [heart monitor beeping]  - Uh, why can't I see?!"
[woman]  Preparing to extract cookie.
[Greta cookie] What?  No! Wait! I'm still awake!
"Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! What's happening?"
"Excuse me? Oh, my God!'"
That's me!
"That's me!  Oh, my God! Where am I?"
I don't know  what's happening!
I don't know  what's happening to me!
[sobbing]
Hello?
Is... is anyone there?
Hello?
- [feedback]  - [Greta cookie] Ow!
Sorry.
[chuckles softly]
"You're probably pretty weirded  out right now, I'm guessing."
"It's OK, you can talk.  I can hear you through this."
- [Greta cookie] Hello?  - Hi.
"I'm Matthew,  I'm from Smartelligence."
My job is to explain what's  happening to you as best I can.
"- Oh, my God! Am I dead?  - No, no. You're not dead."
No one's dead here.
Um...
"...how old did you say  you we're, uh, 30?"
"- Twenty-nine.  - Twenty-nine, Right."
"Uh, so you won't remember  Xerox machines?"
- do you know  What A photocopier is?  - What?
Do you know  what a copy is?
As in a copy of something?  Of course I know what that is.
"Well, that's what you are."
A copy of...?
A copy of you.
- But I Am me.  - OK.
Try to blow on my face.
"You can't,  because you don't have a body."
"Where are your fingers?  Your arms, your face?"
Nowhere. [chuckles]
Because you're code.
"You're a simulated brain  full of code,"
stored in this little widget  we call a cookie.
Why have you  done this to me?
"Ah, well...  Actually you did this to you."
"Uh, real you  is paying for this."
I don't understand.
"You see,  what this is, is a service."
We take a blank cookie
and we surgically implant it  into a client's brain.
It sits there  just under the skin
"for about a week, shadowing."
"Um, soaking up the way  this particular mind works."
That's why you think you're you.  You are you.
Uh... but also not.
"Right. Well, it is a lot  to process, even from inside  a processor."
- Put me back in my body!  - Hm.
"Well, that's where  real you lives."
But... what we will do though  is we will give you a simulated  body.
We find that sometimes  that helps. Are you ready?
"- What? I don't understand!  - Three, and two, one."
[gasps]
[continues gasping]
[Matthew] Hey.
Better?
This is my body.
"Let's not get into that again.  Uh, look around you."
You've got a control room.
What's this for?
"That console, that's for you  to control the house."
"I mean, real you's house."
"Look, um, how do you  like your toast?"
- Wh... What?  - How do you like your toast?
"- Underdone. Slightly Underdone.  - OK, perfect."
Think about  how you like it...
...then just  press the button.
- Which one?  - It doesn't matter.
You already know  you're making toast.
The buttons  are symbolic mostly anyway.
[button hums]
"See, this is your job now."
You're in charge  of everything here.
"Uh, the temperature,  the lighting,"
what time the alarm clock  goes off in the morning.
If there's  no food in the refrigerator.
You...  You're in charge of ordering it.
- for who?  - for real you.
- She's paying.  - Where is real me?
Taking a nap.  In the bedroom. Top right.
[gasps]
I don't want to be in here.
I don't want to be in here.
I don't want to be in here!
- [toaster pops]  - [Matt] Hey.
Just how you like it.
- [screams]  - OK.
Please stop screaming.  Are you going to stop screaming?
Are you going to stop screaming?  No. OK.
[silence]
I'm sorry.  I had to mute you. It...
[no audio]
"- Oh, sorry.  - [Greta cookie panting]"
Look. It'll be much easier  if you just comply.
I'm not doing this.
I'm not some sort of  push-button toaster monkey.
"- Would you prefer  to do nothing?  - Well, I'm not doing this!"
"Right. Well, nothing it is then.  Let me show you what that  is like."
Three weeks sound good?  That should give you a taste.
"What do you mean,  three weeks?"
If you just wait for a...  Just...
- What about now?  - [gasps]
Please. Don't do that again.
Please. There's nothing  to do here. There's nothing.  There's just...
"I mean, there's nothing."
- I did warn you.  - I couldn't even sleep.
You don't need sleep.  Ready to go to work?
"Oh, no, no. No, I'm not.  Definitely not doing that."
"- OK. Well, have six months.  - No. Wait, wait!"
"[Matthew] See, the trick  of it lay in breaking them"
"without letting them snap  completely, if you get me."
Too much time in solitary  and they'd just wig out.
"No use to anyone,  then you'd just sell them cheap"
"to the games industry,  they become"
cannon fodder  for some war thing.
[Matthew continues eating toast]
- How are we feeling now?  - [gasps]
[panting] Please.
Give me something to do.
Ready to work?
"Yes. Yes, please."
I'll do anything.
"I'll do anything, just give me  something to do, please."
- [footsteps approaching]  - OK.
"Great toast, by the way."
Hey.
Is it set up?
You are all set  and ready to go.
"You know, as I was coming here,  I saw this guy with his shirt  off,"
riding a horse  in the middle of the street.
- How weird.  - [chuckles] I swear to God.
[electronic hums and beeps]
"[ Rossini:  ""The Thieving Magpie""]"
"[computerized voice] Good  morning, Greta. Here are  today's appointments."
11am: hair with Stelios.
12.30: Lunch at Barney's  Brasserie with Annabel.
"3pm: Jackanape Gallery  private view, Shoreditch."
6.30: Christmas drinks  with Paolo.
"7.30: The Nutcracker,  Royal Opera House."
That's slavery.
"- A little melodramatic,  isn't it?  - But she thought she was real."
- But she wasn't.  - It's barbaric.
"It wasn't really real,  so it wasn't really barbaric."
"Again, you are not  who I expected."
"Most people would say,"
"""She's only made of code,  she's not real. Fuck her."""
But you're empathetic.
"- You care about people.  - Well, don't you?"
You're a good man.
Am I?
"Based on how you've reacted  to what I've said, yeah."
I can tell you're kind.
I'm not a good man.
A good man  who's done bad things?
You can tell me about it.
I've done stuff in my life  I'm not proud of.
I can't pretend I haven't.
Was it something to do  with your family?
Wife?
Girlfriend?
[chuckles]
It's just us here.
Her dad never liked me.
He never liked me.
"Bloody cold, isn't it?  Come on."
Beth. Bethany.
"[Beth] Dad, what now?"
It gets dark about six.
- We won't be that long!  - Hold on. Let me put  my glove on.
I think he disapproves.
He's just protective.
He thinks  I'm not good enough for you.
"Well, I mean,  he's got a point."
Let me take a photo of you.  Stand there.
Hang on.
I feel so awkward posing.
Come on. Be a supermodel.
- This awkward enough for you?  - It's perfect.
- Right. Ready? That's nice.   - [Beth laughs]
- Hold it there.  - [camera shutter clicks]
[both laugh]
You're such a dick.
"[ Los Bravos:  ""Black Is Black""]"
[sings rock music karaoke]
[Beth whooping]
[woman laughs loudly]
[feedback on microphone]
"We were good together, you know.  We were really good together."
[audience cheering]
Whoo!
[sings melancholy karaoke]
Yeah!
- [bottle clinking]  - Why are you all around there?
"- No. No, we're going home.  Come on.  - Don't manhandle me."
I'm not going to get up  if you all touch me.
I'm not going to get up.  I'm not going to get up.
- It's cool. It's cool.  - [indistinct chattering]
"Come on, Joe.  I'll get your jacket."
"Cheers, mate."
"Things weren't perfection.  These things never are, but..."
...we were really happy.
[all laughing]
I'll let Gita   tell the story.
She loves boring people  with our personal details.
[laughter continues]
"Oh, I'd been working there  for about a fortnight"
"when Beth introduced  the two of us, and ta-da!"
- So it's all Beth's doing.  - She's the puppet-master.
[all laughing]
What was her tip  for winning me over again?
Not to let you  hear me snore.
"We all went on this work trip  once, before Gita's time,"
I fell asleep on the coach back  and snored so loud
that they all thought there was  something wrong with me.
He snores like a bison.
- [Joe] Wow.  - [all laugh]
"Really,  you're telling him that?"
"Oh, another one  bites the dust."
[dishes clattering]
I think she's more into him  than he's into her.
Don't you think?
Is that one finished?
- [Beth] Mmm-hmm.  - Yeah?
You all right?
- I'm tired.  - You've been a bit quiet.
"Just wasn't in the mood,   you know?"
I see them  all the time at work.
I think I'm going  to go to bed. Do you mind?
"No, that's fine."
[whispers] Shit.
Beth?
- What?  - Is This yours?
I just found it in the bin.  That means pregnant.
Is it yours?
Yes.
[laughs]
"I mean, that..."
Christ.
"That's amazing, I mean...  It's just..."
"Joe, I can't."
"A baby,  a pregnancy... not now."
"Not right now, I can't."
"Of course you can. My God,  you'll be an amazing mum."
"- No. I'm 27, I'm not ready.  - Who's ever ready?"
"It's not... it's just too quick,  OK? It's all too quick."
- We'll manage.  I'll surprise you.  - You're not listening.
- I can be responsible  when pushed.  - Joe.
"You can put your feet up,  I'll do shoulder rubs,  paint the house."
"- Joe, please.   - We'll be like a couple  in a DIY ad."
- Joe... I don't want it.  - We'll be like a family.
- But it's a baby.  - Joe.
"- I mean, it's our baby.  - I know, and it's not  easy for me."
"- Well, let's at least  discuss this.  - No. I've made up my mind."
"Well, I haven't."
"God, look at you."
You're pissed.
"You drank all night, Beth."
You drank all night.
"Jesus Christ, you're pregnant."
"Yeah, well,  I don't want to be."
- And I'm not going to be.  - You're being a bitch.
- Stop it.  - You're being a cold bitch
- who would kill a kid.  - That's not fair.
Who'd get it torn out because  it doesn't suit her plans.
- Stop or I'll block you.  - Don't you dare.
"No. We can talk tomorrow,  just please stop."
- Don't you fucking dare.  - [Beth panting]
"[Joe] Turn it off!  Turn it off, you...!"
[muffled shouting]
"Listen to me, Beth!  Turn it off!"
You turn it off!
Turn it off!
"You turn it off, Beth!"
Beth? Turn it off! Please!
Turn it off.
[keys rattling]
- [door opens]  - Beth?
"Wait!  I'm sorry, I was pissed."
"Can we just talk about  this properly, please?"
"I've said some really awful  shit. Beth, I love you."
"Listen,  we can work this out."
[muffled shouting]
"Beth, please!"
Beth!
"That day, I didn't go to work.  I just stayed at home and..."
...tried to work out  how to make amends.
But she just  didn't come back.
"And thanks to the block,  I couldn't..."
I couldn't message her.  I couldn't call her.
"After a week,  I was pretty desperate."
"So I just hung around outside  her work, like a stalker."
Tim! Gita!
Have you seen Beth?
"Um, she left."
"Left. What, like...?"
Handed in her notice.
No one knows where she is.
[Gita] Joe?
"- Joe!  - No, leave him."
"I was still hopeful  that she would get in touch,"
or at least remove the block  so that I could contact her.
But no.
"When there's a block,  you can't even wallow properly."
You can't switch it off.
You can't take  the Zed-Eyes out.
"And it doesn't just block them,  it blocks every image of them."
So every memory  I had of her was vandalised.
And then one day  I'm out in town and...
...it was her.
She was pregnant.
She'd kept it.
"Well, I just sort of lost it.  I just ran over"
and started pleading with her.  Just pleading.
[muffled]
Turn it off. Turn it off.  Just turn it off.
"- Turn it off.  Beth, turn it off.  - Help. Get him off me!"
Some passer-by  called the police.
They took me  down the station.
And that was that.
"So, by now, the block's  got legal backing."
"And there's a GPS so that if  I go within ten metres of her,"
"bang, I get arrested."
Harsh.
"Yeah, and I've got no idea  where she is."
If... Whether she's had  the baby or not.
Whether it's a boy  or a girl.
If it's OK.
I've got absolutely no way  of getting in touch with her.
"Except, um,  I knew where her dad lived."
"So I write her a letter,  this begging letter."
"Laying it all out, you know,  and, um, I get no response."
So I write again...
...and again...
...and again.
No response.
She cut you out good.
But there was one thing  I could do.
"I knew she spent every Christmas  with him at his place,"
so I knew that she would  definitely be there.
"So, the day before,  Christmas Eve, I headed up."
And where her dad lived  was this isolated place  in the back of beyond.
I'd never been up there   without her.
It was weird being  on the outside.
I waited there all day.  Until...
"Well, I had to take  a closer look."
"You alright  to get those bags, Beth?"
"And there's her dad  with our baby, but I can't  even see its face because..."
Legal blocks  cover offspring too.
Been there.
That hurts.
[Joe] I couldn't even tell  if it was a boy or a girl.
I know it sounds stupid...
...but seeing something...
...was better than nothing.
So I kept going back.
It became  an annual pilgrimage.
Once a year I'd head up there  and watch them from a distance.
"Watching the kid grow up,  you know?"
[muffled]
More than anything I just wanted  to make some sort of contact.
Anything.
"So, one Christmas, kid must  have been about four by now,"
I headed up there and I took  a little present with me.
"Just a small, stupid thing."
"For the first time,  I could see she was a girl."
I had a daughter.
"So, Santa Claus..."
...did you try it  again next year?
Something happened  before then.
It had been a few months since  I'd been up there to look  at my daughter.
"I was just sat at home watching  TV, flipping through the  channels."
[man on TV] ...which claimed  the lives of 26 people
on a quiet Wednesday morning.
"Passengers like Palab Ghatak,  just 18, on his way to his  first job interview,"
"like Bethany Grey, the young  mother who'd only recently  started...'"
[pauses TV]
"It had been so long since  I'd seen her, it was hard  to imagine"
anything but that shadow  in her place.
But now that the block  had died with her...
...there she was.
She was gone.
[sobbing]
Sorry.
"But there was, uh,  one silver lining..."
...with the block gone.
You'd get  to see your daughter.
"It was almost Christmas, so  I bought her this snow globe."
Just a present to give her.
And I headed up  to Beth's dad's.
And there she was.
Not a silhouette...
...but real.
"Hello, darling."
[gasps]
[melancholy song plays]
[song fades]
"What is it, May?  Would you like a drink?"
[Christmas music on radio]
What are you doing here?
Beth's dead.
Do you understand?
She's dead.
There's nothing for you here.
Where's my daughter?
What daughter?
This is Beth's daughter.
I want to see my daughter.
"May, go upstairs."
If this is about  those letters...
...I threw them out  before she saw them.
"She was a mess, she'd had  to leave everything behind."
I want to see my daughter.
I think you should go.
Get out of this house.
I want to see my daughter.
You have no daughter here!
[shouts in pain]
- [clattering]  - [panting]
[exhales last breath]
[birds chirping]
It was that clock.
It was that clock.
Then what happened?
Tell me.
[Joe] I just left.
I go out in the car  and I just drove.
Anywhere.  I don't know where.
I walked  into the nearest town
"and I, um... I slept  on the streets and drank."
"After a while, I don't know  how long, a couple of months,  they picked me up."
They wanted me to talk  but I couldn't talk...
"...because if I said it,  it would be real."
"So I didn't say anything,  I didn't tell them."
And what about the girl?
What happened to the girl?
[sniffling]
I only know what they said.
What did they say?
- What Did they say?  - What Is This place?
- What Did they say?  - What job do We do here?
"- Our job. the job.  - Joe, stay with me."
What did they say?
"What did they say, Joe?"
That she just...  she just stayed in the house.
"It was, um..."
"It was Christmas Eve,  so she just..."
...she just stayed hidden.  She didn't move.
Then on Boxing Day she realised  that no one was going to help.
"Then she, um, gave her grandad  a present that she'd made."
And she went out  to go and get help.
How far did she get?
May God forgive me.  God forgive me.
So you confess?
Joe?
Just say it.
Just let it out.
I confess. I confess.
[whimpering]
Whoo! I knew I could do it.
Boom! I told you I'd get it.
"All right, I'm coming out."
"Sorry, Joe."
[exhales deeply]
Well? That had to be enough.
Full confession.  Clear conviction.
Well done.
"Two days we pressed him  and he said piss all,"
this bastard cracks him  in 70 minutes.
"He knows he's guilty,  he needed to unload."
"It wasn't really 70 minutes,  not to him."
"When he was first ingested,  I tweaked the time preferences,"
made it seem like five years  from his perspective.
Some might say that five years  with me is punishment enough.
Wait here.
Mr Potter.
Congratulations  on your confession.
That cookie we took out  of your head just gave us  the full story.
So you can keep the silent act  up as long as you want.
"Makes no difference,  you've already talked."
"Also, Merry Christmas."
So... The deal?
"Break a confession from him  and I go free, right?"
"I'm the expert,  you needed me."
That's one  for the Home Office.
"We'll make good on the offer.  You're free to go, Mr Trent."
[relieved sigh]
[woman] With some caveats.
- Caveats?  - You'll be on the register.
What register?
The one  for Peeping Tom pervs.
All I did was help some lonely  guys by providing a service.
An illegal service.
"You also failed  to report a murder,"
"fatal poisoning,  in case you've forgotten."
"Kept that information from your  Cookie Monster mate, didn't you?"
"What does it mean,  this register?"
- It means you're blocked.  - By who?
By everyone.

"Hey, come on."
Just changing  the time settings.
"Cranked him up  to 1,000 years a minute."
There's a proper sentence. Or do  you want me to switch him off?
No. Leave him   on for Christmas.

Landlord is sending buyers over today  so... put your pants on.
"Maybe if I don't,  it'll scare 'em off and we can stay here."
"[singsong] Not an option, Ryan.  Lease is up in four weeks."
"Hey, I'm thinking of you.  I've got somewhere to go."
Nate's roommate took a job in Phoenix  so I get his place.
-Okay.  -Now who's the slow poke?
I'm... seeing some places over lunch.  Catch you later.

[Lacie] How's Pancakes?
He's hilarious.  Such a funny cat. Just the best.
[both laugh]
-Are you still at Hoddicker?  -Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. It's going pretty great.  -Good to hear.
"-So what brings you back here?  -New job, first day."
-first day?  -at Blankman-Harper.
Whoa! Top floor! That's...
"-Well, good luck.  -I know, right? [laughs]"
It's great you're still happy  at Hoddicker.
"-Well, maybe not forever.  -No, not forever."
-But for now...  -It's OK for now.

Sure. Okay.
[gasps]
Mmm!
[phone beeps]
Thank you. Thank you.
[whispers]  We're kind of not talking to Ches.
-3.1? What happened?  -Him and Gordon split up.
Oh...
"-Poor Ches.  -No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side."
Sure! Obviously.
Ches is kissing ass.  Trying to scrape himself back.
"Of course, if it drops below two-five,  then it's... bye-bye."

[Lacie] Hello?
"-[Ryan] Yo, they're taking it.  -Who?"
The couple the landlord sent over.  I heard them talking.
Okay.
"So,  now we move into the light space area."
Ideal for special times with loved ones.
"-Great food, great company.  -Mm-hmm!"
-[phone beeps]  -Whoa! [laughs]
[woman]  Sampled your photo stream to make her.
Great hair!

"Oh, my God. [giggles]"
[Lacie] It's hilarious!
[woman] You like him?
-He's okay.  -He doesn't come with the apartment.
[both laugh]
"But there is a bar and restaurant  on site, tenants only."
We have unparalleled metrics  on romantic geneses.
Uh-huh.
"[woman] I gotta say,  these places are going like ""that."""
"-So don't delay if you're interested.  -Oh, I'm more than interested."
"Standard occupancy  on a minimum six-month contract,"
we're talking... this much.
-How often are the payments?  -That's weekly.
-Okay.  -[woman laughs]
-a little more than expected?  -Yeah.
There's options.
You know our Prime Influencers Programme?
"-Do I qualify for that?  -No. No, you don't."
We'd need you around a 4.5.
4.5?
Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.
-4.5.  -That's right.
[sighs]
[laughs]
[sighs]
[laughter]
[beeps]
[laughs softly]
Pelican Cove? What is this?  A eugenics programme?
-a lifestyle community.  -No one is this happy.
A two-year-old with a fucking balloon  isn't this happy.
It's actually a pretty cool place.
Like you'd even qualify.
"There's nothing I can do, sir."
"[man] Well, it's not hopeless,  you're clearly a tryer."
That's the sense you get just from... me?
From your rep report analytics.
"If we drill down into the numbers,  you've got a solid popularity arc here."
Strong overall trajectory.  Let's just look at the last 24 hours.
"You see, even--"
What's that? 8:40 a.m.  You're working hard on your socials.
-Great little uptake there.  -Okay.
Couple of minor dings there.  You cut someone off in traffic?
"Oh, just a workplace thing. [laughs]"
Okay.  Let's check on your sphere of influence.
Let me zoom out here.
"Great peripherals.  Strangers like you, that's a plus."
-Healthy inner circle. It's good.  -Thank you. [giggles]
"There's a ways to go,  but 4.5 is certainly achievable."
How long do you think?
-To hit 4.5?  -Mm-hmm.
"Well, barring a major setback,"
"a public disgrace kind of deal,  I'd say 18 months or so."
"Oh, I need more short term.  Like... much more. [laughs]"
Then you'll need a boost.
-what kind of a boost?  -Well...
Most of your interactions are confined   to your inner circle
"and they're largely, pardon the term,  mid- to low-range folks."
Same with your outer circle.
"You've got a ton of reciprocal five stars  from service industry workers,"
but there's not much else.
At least as far as I can see.
"So in terms of quality,  you could use a punch up right there."
"Ideally,  that's up votes from quality people."
-Quality people?  -High fours.
"Impress those up-scale folks,  you'll gain velocity on your arc"
and there's your boost.
[phone beeps]
[panting]
"-Oh, hi, JJ!  -Hey, Lacie!"
-Keith! Hello.  -Lacie!
-[Keith] You look great today.  -Thank you!
"-Door won't open. I'm on 2.4.  -Sorry, Ches. I'm late."
"I just need some stars, please!"
Fuck!
[elevator bell dings]
"-Oh, hi!  -Hi!"
-How's it going at Blankman?  -Just great.
"-Well, I bet you work... good there.  -Thank you."
Would you like a croissant?
They gave me an extra at the coffee place.
"-Oh, No, I already ate.  -Okay, sure. All good. Yes."
Yeah.
"-[elevator bell dings]  -Well, here's me, so..."
-[giggles]  -[phones beep]
Don't try too hard.  It's impossible to respect.
High fours can smell it a mile off.  Just be you.
"Authentic gestures, that's the key."
"-That's time up, I'll catch you later.  -Oh, could I just ask--"

Who even are you?
"It's just something I wanna eat, Ryan."

[gasps]
"Oh, my God."
-What is it?  -Naomi!
Shit!
"Old school, el perfecto Naomi?  You guys keep in contact?"
"Ryan, just go! Go!"
"[Lacie] Oh, my God!  Nay-Nay, how are you? [giggles]"
I was just fixing myself a snack.
"Oh, Lace, could I just say  I am so happy to see your face?"
-Me too. It's been...  -Too long.
-Way too long.  -And that's my fault.
"-No, it's mine. Everything is just so...  -Everything's just so..."
"Crazy! Oh, it's so good to see you."
When you posted that Mr. Rags photo...
"I know, Mr. Rags!"
I just had to call
and talk to you because...
Whoo-hoo!
"[screams, laughs]"
Wow! That's a... big ring! [laughs]
"Congratulations! Who's the, um... Paul?"
He is great. So smart. Just sweet.
I know you're gonna love him.
Uh-huh.
"So, anyways, the big day..."
"Yes, when is it?"
"So, we're getting married in a month"
on his family's estate
up here on the island.
"This place outside Port Mary, Honeysuckle.  You heard of it?"
"No, but..."
"Well, it's a private island."
[singsong] Take a looooook!
"Oh, wow! That is... [giggles]"
"I know, right? So... can you make it?"
Are you kidding? Of course.
"Great, cool, cos I was wondering if..."
"Lace, do you think..."
Would you be my maid of honour?
Seriously?
"Oh, my God."
"I mean, you've got such cool friends now.  Are you sure?"
"Remember when we used to plan our  dream weddings when we were, like, 11?"
"-I know but we haven't s--  -I don't know, just seeing Mr. Rags..."
All the memories.  It just brought things home.
"Oh, Nay-Nay."
I know we haven't kept in touch  as much as I'd have liked
"and that is totally my fault,  but this is a big day."
"A big life day and I want my oldest  friend with me, my oldest friend."
I want you by my side.
"Oh, my God. Thank you."
What do I have to...
"Not much to it. A speech, mainly."
Speech? Of course!
Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?
"Oh, my gosh, like... [sings] hundreds!"
It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.
"Paul's invited so many,  I don't want to call them big deals,"
"but they're all, like,  4.7 or above."
Uh-huh.
"Nay-Nay, I will not let you down.  [giggles]"
Don't sweat too much!  Just talk about old memories.
"-sure.  -How we were, any old things."
-Gotcha.  -I'll ping you some anecdotes.
-That would be great.  -And what's your dress size?
"Oh, um..."
"I'll tell you what,  I'll just send you a four."
-Perfect.  -we got matching bridesmaids dresses.
"Well, anyway..."
[both scream]
[both laugh]
"Love you, Lay."
"You too, Nay-Nay! [giggles]"
Oh!
Bye.
[laughs nervously]
[beeping]
[sighs]
What was that? The F-word?
You two pussy pals now?
[sighs] Shut up.
"-She was always mean to you.  -No, she wasn't."
-She had That rhyme about you.  -That was a game.
-what about when She cut your hair?  -I asked her to.
She fucked Greg.
She... did not fuck Greg. [laughs]
She looked hot. I'll give her that.
[man] Okay.
Impressive.
"-Uh-huh. Jesus. Yeah, that'd do it.  -Mm-hmm."
[phone rings]
[woman] Pelican Cove.
"Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the place yesterday.  I wanna take it."
That's fantastic!
"Uh... Oh, I see you're still on a 4.2.  Is that, um..."
"Yep, I'm on it,  just gonna transfer the deposit now."
"-Well, okay.  -Yes!"
"In this world,  we're all so caught up in our own heads."
It's easy to lose sight of what's real.  What matters.
But as I stand here today...
"seeing the joy Paul has brought  to Naomi's life,"
I know she's someone  who truly matters to me.
[laughs]
"Nay-Nay,"
"the little girl who, when we were just  five-years-old in art camp,"
started talking to me  because she saw I was scared.
The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags.  I still have him. [giggles]
He sits on my desk and...
"every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay."
What she meant to me then and now.
I am so honored to be here
and I wish you all the happiness  this stupid world can muster.
"I love you, Nay-Nay."
Is the tear too much?
-You fucking sociopath.  -[phone beeps]
"-Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?  -What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?"
I do keep him on my desk.
There's sugary  and then there's fucking diabetes.
I just wanna make her happy  on her wedding day.
"The captive audience of 4-point holies  five-starring your ass off,"
that's just a bonus.
-Naomi and I were best friends.  -[laughing] Come on...
I wish her well  and wanna express it the best I can.
"And, yeah, if I nail a speech  and get five-starred"
"by hundreds of primes, so what?  It's a win-win."
"What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?"
Unh-unh.  You get points from your gaming buddies.
It's the same thing.  Don't shit on me for aiming higher.
Pelican Cove higher?
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?  They're great apartments!
-They are fake-smile jail cells.  -[phone beeps]
Great. Car cancelled.
"And he marked me down so now I have  to book another, and I took a ding."
"-Great job.  -I am sorry, But I miss the normal you."
"Before this obsession,  when we had conversations, remember?"
I need my charger.
"This whole ranking thing,  just comparing yourself to people who--"
-Have you seen my charger?  -...only pretend to be happy.
I said don't borrow this!
"High fours like Naomi,  I bet they're suicidal on the inside."
My car is here. Again.
"Your Pelican Cove deposit,  is it refundable?"
"Like, what if this doesn't work?"
-Can't you just stay out of my shit?  -You're my sister!
"Yes! And if you cared about that,  maybe you would've noticed"
living with you hasn't been  one big rainbow sandwich for me.
Do you know why  I never brought any guys back here?
Because I didn't want them  to know I was sharing a skanky-ass cave
with Mr. Three Point Fuck.
Good luck with your performance!

"Hey, Lace! Just checking in."
I'm on my way to the airport right now.  [giggles]
"Okay, cool, and you're all good  for the rehearsal dinner?"
"Oh, yeah. The flight's, what, an hour?  That restaurant looks so cool."
-Uh-huh. And you got the dress okay?  -Mm-hmm. In my case. [giggles]
-I love the pink.  -Uh-huh.
So the latest draft  of the speech is great.
Going handwritten's so cool.
"Those scans of the page,  my God, I welled up just at that."
"-Oh, thank you!  -Um... just one thought."
That whole bit where I help you  with the eating disorder thing...
"-You think that's a little...  -A little over-sharing, yeah."
You're so right. It's gone.
"Okay. Cool.  Well, I'll see you in a few hours!"
I'm getting married tomorrow
[screams]
[laughs]
-And here's your tip. [giggles] Thank you.  -[phone beeps]
"Oh, come on."
"[woman on loudspeaker]   May I have your attention, please..."
"-hi there, How Are you doing?  -I am wonderful."
[laughs]
"I am so sorry, that flight is cancelled."
"-No. No, No, No.  -Customer incident at the other end."
But... So when is the next flight?
"Yeah, they're all kind of full."
Uh... I booked this weeks ago.  It's my best friend's wedding.
-I'm sorry.  -I have to get there. I have to.
Okay-- let's see what we can do.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I see there's one standby seat  on another plane leaving tonight.
-[sighs]   -Uh...
That's reserved for members  of our Prime Flight Programme.
You gotta be a 4.2 or over to qualify.
"-Oh, I'm... I'm a 4.2.  -Uh-huh."
I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.
"Oh. Well, that's not my fault. Um..."
Some woman dinged me down in the...  Can't you just--
"I'm sorry, it won't let me book it  without the correct ranking."
-But it's so close.  -There's just nothing I can do.
"-Christ, I mean, surely.  -I'm gonna have to ask you"
to moderate your language there.
Sorry. It's just...
I'm maid of honour.  I cannot miss this wedding.
And I am so sorry about that.
-Can you call the supervisor?  -I cannot Do that.
-Can you just call the supervisor?  -I cannot Do that.
"-Call the fucking supervisor!  -Okay, that's profanity."
-We're zero tolerance on profanity.  -I'm sorry. It's just--
"-I Have To serve the next customer.  -No, No, No, No."
"-Can you step away, ma'am?  -God, just fucking help me!"
Ooh.
[phones beep]
I'm so sorry.
"-I've called security.  -Oh, no, no, no. Please don't do that."
"I'm, uh... five-starring you. Five stars."
"-What's the issue here, Hannah?  -Intimidation and profanity."
"-Oh, no, no. I was not intimidating.  -Don't speak, ma'am."
-I was just trying to--  -Ma'am.
"Okay. So, in order to restore calm,"
I'm invoking my authority  as airport security
to dock you one full ranking point  as a punitive measure.
-This is a temporary measure.  -[gasps] No!
"-Your score reverts to normal in 24 hours.  -No, no, no. But I need it now."
"During this period, all down votes  are subject to a times two multiplier."
Times two?
We recommend you avoid negative feedback  at this time.
I'm on double damage?
"Please, remove yourself  from the airport immediately."
[phone beeps]
"Okay, well, due to your ranking..."
[chattering]
[baby crying]
Hi there. Chuck! Great name.
-Thank you.  -Hope you're having a great night.
-It's pretty good.  -So I need a car.
"-you got a vehicle In mind?  -Anything, really."
"Well, due to your current ranking,"
you're restricted   to our super saver fleet.
-Yep. That's... Yeah.  -I-Cruiser 2?
They still have the 2?
[alarm beeps]
[beeping]
"-[woman speaking driver alert in Czech]  -Oh, God."
[woman repeating driver alert in Czech]
"[beep, wipers creaking]"
[woman repeating driver alert in Czech]
"-[music on TV]  -Oh, come on."
Uh...
[men speaking Czech on TV]
-[beeping]  -Damn it!
[laughs]
[sighs]
[Czech dialogue continues]
[engine sputters]
[engine starts]
"The little girl, who when we were both  five years old in art camp,"
[sobs] started talking to me  because she saw I was scared.
The girl who helped me make Mr. Rags...
Teardrop. Crowd goes wild.  You can do this.
-[ringtone plays]  -[woman speaking Czech]
"-Sorry, okay, I swear I'm on my way.  -[Naomi] How far away are you?"
Uh... Quite a ways. I missed my flight.
"-What?  -Well, not missed It but..."
So you're not gonna make  the rehearsal dinner?
-No.  -Lacie!
I am so sorry. It's been... [groans]
I got a rental car. I'm driving.
Driving? That's like nine hours.
"I'm making good time,"
"gonna go through the night,  make a road trip out of it. [laughs]"
Is everything okay?
I can find a replacement  if something's wrong.
No. No. No. I'll be there.  I swear on Mr. Rags.
Ha ha ha!
"Okay, just drive safe!"
-[girls squealing]  -You bet. I'll just--
[phone beeping]
[phone beeps]
Come on.
Come on.
Please.
-[phone beeps]  -[sighs]
Okay.
[yawns]
[woman speaking Czech]
-What do you want?  -[woman speaking Czech]
[beeping]
[woman speaking Czech]
"-Oh, shit.  -[woman's speaking tempo slows]"
Hi. Sorry.
[woman moaning]
Your charger doesn't fit my car.
-Don't see those around much these days.  -It's a rental.
"Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.  They didn't give you an adapter?"
No. Do you have one?
"-not In here. Ask around.  -Thanks, anyway."
You're super helpful.
[phone beeps]
[phone beeps]
[gasps]
Two stars?!
Two stars?
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.
"[Lacie] Sir, excuse me."
"Excuse me, sorry."
"Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?"
"Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter,  perhaps, in the trunk of your car?"
Sure.
Great.
"Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?"
I have a rental car. It's...
[grunting]
"-Slow down. Let's give her a ride.   -[man] She's, like, 2.8."
[phone beeps]
Come on!
[phone beeps]
I didn't even do anything!
You look like you need a ride.
Um...
"Actually, I'm okay."
Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.
"Blue thermos is coffee, red's whiskey.  Help yourself."
I'm okay. Thanks.
Where are you headed?
Uh... Just as close as you can get  to Port Mary would be great. [laughs]
Checking my feed for danger signs?
"I get it a lot.  1.4 gotta be an antisocial maniac, right?"
-you seem...  -Normal?
-Yeah.  -Thank you.
It took some effort.  What happened to you?
"I mean, you're a 2.8,  but you don't look 2.8."
That's not-- This is temporary.
-I'm gonna turn it around.  -Uh-huh.
-I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.  -Nice.
Wanna hear my speech?
No.
So how come you're a 2.8?
"Well, I got marked down  at the airport for yelling,"
and they put me on double damage.
-How did It feel?  -Awful.
I meant the yelling.
I don't know. I was mad.
Look at where it got me.
"But as long as I get to the wedding,  do the speech,"
they'll overlook the 2.8.  I'm with the bride.
"And if I do well,  well, they're all high fours"
so that velocitates my arc.
"And once they lift the point penalty,  well, my average goes way up,"
"and, yeah, it's gonna be okay."
"God, you remind me of me."
-hmm.  -not now.
"I was, uh... 4.6 once."
-4.6?  -Used to live for it.
All the work I put in...
"Eight years ago,  Tom, my husband, got cancer."
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.  The symptoms showed up late.
I'm so sorry.
You don't know me  so you're not really sorry.
You're just mainly awkward  cos I have sprung some cancer talk at you.
"Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,"
"every nurse, every high-four  consultant that we had."
Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.
The cancer didn't give a shit.  It just kept growing.
"A couple of months in, we heard  about this experimental treatment."
It was very expensive. It was very exclusive.
I did everything I could  to get him a spot there.
Tom was a 4.3.
They gave his bed to a 4.4.
"So when he died I thought, fuck it."
"I started saying what I wanted,  when I wanted."
Just drop it out there.
People don't always like that.
It is incredible  how fast you slip off the ladder
when you start doing that.
It turned out a lot of my friends  didn't care for honesty.
Treated me like I had taken a shit  at their breakfast table.
"But, Jesus Christ, it felt good."
Shedding those fuckers.
It was like taking off tight shoes.
"-Maybe you should try it?  -Oh, come on. [laughs]"
Why not?
I can't just kick off my shoes  and walk the earth or whatever.
"-You won't know unless you try.  -Oh, that's just..."
"Look, you had something with your life,"
"real things, good things,  and you lost it all, and I'm sorry."
So now you've got nothing left to lose.
"But I don't even have the something  worth losing, not yet."
"You know,  I mean, I'm still fighting for that."
"-And what is ""that""?  -I don't know. Enough. To be content?"
"Like, to look around and think,  well, I guess I'm okay."
"Just to be able to breathe out,  not feeling like... like..."
"Like just...  And that is way off, like, way, way off."
"And until I get there,  I have to play the numbers game."
"We all do, that's what we're in.  That's how the fucking world works."
"Look, maybe you don't remember,  you know, you're just too old to get it."
I do not mean that how it sounds.
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.
-Sweetheart.  -[gasps] What time is it?
I'm heading east from here so I think  you need to get yourself another ride.
-Where are we?  -About 30 miles from Port Mary.
A lot of buses stop here  so you should be fine.
"-Well, Thank you.  -good luck with your speech."
[laughs]
I put a little something in there  for you.
-You did?  -Emergency escape hatch!
Bye.
"[Lacie] In this world,  we're all so caught up..."
-[door opens]  -...in our own dramas.
"-[girl] So, Dad was like...  -It's easy to forget what matters."
[girl] He'd never even heard of the show.
"I'm like, ""You never heard  of Sea of Tranquillity?"""
"Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,"
"and he's all like, ""What the fuck?"" Whatever!"
I think I'm allergic to this purple.
"So I'm like, ""Well, I'm going  to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary."
"That's why I'm dressed  like Lieutenant Duster."""
"He's all like, ""Uh... Port Mary is  frickin' miles away."""
"Yadda, yadda, yadda."
"-[toilet flushes]  -He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad."
-[girl 1] See you back on there.   -[girl 2] Okay.
Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?
-You're into Sea of Tranquillity?  -Totally.
I was all set to go.
"My friend, who is there already,  has my costume, but my car broke down."
"Well, there's some space in the RV."
-Hi.  -Hey!
"-You're a Trank head, huh?  -Sorry?"
Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?
"Oh, yeah.  We say Tranksters where I'm from."
-Who's your favourite character?  -Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.
-She's awesome.  -She?
He! I misspoke.
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.
"I know, and that's why  it's so hard to remember, right?"
-[ringtone playing]  -Excuse me. Gotta get this.
"My friend, at the convention. [giggles]"
"Hi, Nay! [laughs]"
"So, oh, my God,  insane night, but I am so close now."
[Naomi] Don't come.
"What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away."
Don't come. I don't want you here.
"I don't know what is up with you,  but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding."
"Oh, no, that's temporary!  That's temporary."
"Well, the wedding's today so..."
-But it doesn't change anything.  -Lacie...
-I Can still Do the same speech.  -Lacie...
-And there's Mr. Rags!  -No!
But... But you invited me.
"You've seen the guest list.  They are all, like, 4.5 or above."
"They are going to freak at a 2.6,  and I am not taking that kind of damage,"
"plus I haven't dipped under  a 4.7 in, like, six months."
You said you wanted your oldest friend.
"When I asked you to speak,  you were a 4.2, okay?"
And the authenticity of a vintage bond  low four at a gathering of this calibre
played fantastically  on all the simulations we ran.
Forecast was a prestige bounce  of .2 minimum.
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.
That just puts the stink on things  a little too much.
That just plays badly for us.
So it was just about numbers for you?
"Oh, cut the shit!  It was numbers for both of us."
"You wanted those primo votes,  don't deny it."
It's not like you could get them  on your own. Let's not kid ourselves.
"Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes."
What? You're just gonna roll up here  and make people like you?
"-That's right. I'm doing my speech.  -No, you're not."
"Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me  through the roof when they hear it."
-Weep their fucking eyes out!  -Go home!
-[phone beeping]  -Hello?
[sighs] Fuck!
I have never seen  your stupid fucking show.
[tyres screech]
[shouts] Hope they cancel it!
-[horn honks]  -I need a ride!
[shouts]
-[phone beeping]  -Fuck!
Jesus!
[engine roars]
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
-Can I borrow your bike?  -What?
Can I borrow your bike?
"Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,  take this man to be your husband,"
to live together with him  in the covenant of marriage?
"To love him, comfort him,"
"honour and keep him,  in sickness and in health..."
"and forsaking all others,  be faithful unto him..."
[cheering and applause]
[indistinct radio chatter]
[revs engine]
[screams]
[applause]
"To my best mate, Anthony.  Let's hear it for him."
[cheering]
"You've been there from day one.  I love you, man. I appreciate you."
"Hilarious speech, by the way.  By your standards."
[laughter]
-Pow! Pow! Pow!  -Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs]
"[Paul] He's still got a few bullets left.  Oh, man."
"Oh, gosh, well, um..."
[gasps] Shit!
[Paul] We have so many people to thank.  Our beautiful bridesmaids.
"-[cheering]   -But, of course,"
"my most heartfelt thanks,  my warmest thanks,"
"are to someone who's my best friend,"
"my lover and now,  I'm honoured to say, my wife."
-Naomi!  -[cheering and whooping]
"-[cheering]  -[Paul] One, two, three! Naomi!"
-[man] The A Team!  -[phone beeps]
"I love you so much, darl."
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!
"[man] Congratulations, sir."
"-Thank you.  -No, Thank you."
-[whooping]  -Get over here!
Get your ass over here.
"-Get in here, big boy.  -[phones beep]"
-You're beautiful!  -[cheering]
Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!
"You fucking earned it, man.  You fucking earned it."
[giggles nervously]
"Everybody, hello!"
"-Oh, my God.  -I love you."
Can everyone be quiet for a moment?
Thank you. [giggles]
-Get rid of her.  -That would play Awful.
She's a fucking 1.1.
"Now for those of you who don't know me,  which is... all of you..."
my name is Lacie Pound
"and, believe it or not,  I am one of Naomi's oldest friends."
"Hi, Nay-Nay!"
"It's great to meet you too, Paul.  I've heard a lot about you."
"He's a pretty big deal, that Paul."
-Pretty big deal.  -[camera shutter clicks]
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.
[laughs] Uh...
"Anyway, um... I..."
have looked up to Naomi  pretty much my entire life.
"We met when we were five years old,"
"and right up through to our   teenage years, we made quite the pair."
"We'd talk about all the things  girls talk about,"
"you know, boys, hair, products,  uh... more boys. [laughs]"
"I mean, I tried sometimes  to expand our range a little"
"and talk about climate change,  but she found that kind of boring so..."
Go on.
"She was probably right.  I mean, fuck the planet, right?"
Whoo!
"Yes, thank you! Come on.  Let's have a little fun here."
"You know, fuck the planet! [laughs]"
-[shouts] Fuck the planet!  -[feedback]
[crockery rattles]
-[phone beeps]  -Anyway...
"I... looked up to Naomi  pretty much my entire life,"
which meant she was looking down on me.
Always with a smile though. [laughs]
"In high school,  she was my shoulder to cry on."
She seemed to enjoy that.  Guys and me never worked out.
"They'd see Naomi and just...  Whoo! You know, that was it."
"She had this tight ass,"
like two fists.
Uh-huh.
[giggles] I was all like...
[giggles]
I was like...
through the hallways in high school.
[cackling]
[phones beep]
[cries]
And she was there for me.
Holding my hair back...
"as I knelt,  vomiting, in front of the crapper."
"Thank you for that, Naomi."
I always wished I was you.
And...
I guess that's why you kept me around  so long?
Until you got your new job
and your fancy new friends.
And that...
[laughs]
...fucking... jackhole!
And you didn't need me.  You probably got another me.
"Guess there's some other ""yeth Beth""  you moved on to like a succubus."
"-[phones beeping]  -I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!"
-[crowd gasps]  -Stay back.
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!
I'll cut his head off  and stick it up my ass!
[gasps]
[gasps] Time's nearly up!
-Hey!Calm down.   -I...
"I just wanted to say, in this world  so caught up in our own shit,"
-let's not forget what matters.  -It's okay. It's okay.
"Happiness, fucking Paul and Naomi,  and she's..."
She... She fucked Greg!
I know she did.
-I know you did.  -No...
Don't even try to deny--
-[screams]  -[feedback screeches]
"The little girl who, when we were  just five-years-old in art camp,"
started talking to me  because she saw I was scared
and helped me make Mr. Rags.
He reminds me of you  and what you meant to me then!
[cries] And I'm so honoured to be here  to see this shit!
"[screams] I love you, Nay-Nay!  I've always loved you!"
I love you!
[camera shutter clicking]
[whirring]
[breathes deeply]
[sobs]
[laughs]
What the fuck are you looking at?
Just what I was wondering.
Well...
Don't!
Don't? Don't wonder?
Uh-huh.
-It would be a dull world without wonder.  -I don't give a shit about your world.
I don't like your brassiere.
I don't like your moustache.
I don't like your aura.
-my aura?  -Yeah.
I don't like your... head.
Your entire head is just ridiculous to me.
Really?
You look like an alcoholic  former weatherman.
You sound like a lost little lamb
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.
What sort of cartoon character  did your mum have to fuck
to brew you up in the womb?
"At least I look like I was born,"
not shit out by some tormented  cow creature in an underground lab.
You got tossed out of that lab.
"-Oh, yeah?  -Oh, Yeah, flushed out."
-Ooh!  -In the trash!
-your face is a fucking...  -Fucking.
Fucking biological car crash
"that made Picasso screw his eyes up  and say,"
"""Well, that just don't make sense."""
[laughs]
-You're a fucking asshole. -Fuck you!
-Fuck you next Wednesday. -Fuck you for Christmas!
[glass cracks]
[exhales]
[closes door quietly]
[birds tweet]
[phone vibrates]
[rattling]
[banging]
[helicopter whirrs]
[roars]
[tone sounds]
I'm gonna have to ask you  to switch that off for now.
"Okay, thanks."
[rattling continues]
You know what it's kinda like?  It's kinda like a rollercoaster.
You know what I mean?  It's like a roller coaster.
-[banging]  -[giggles]
"Try it, try it with me."
How tall-- How tall is the Eye?
How tall-- How tall is Big Ben?
[chattering]
All right
"Since then, I've been working  as a technology correspondent"
for about two years now.  It's been great.
"Cool, that's awesome. So you do, like,  TV reports and, like, you're like..."
"-No, just the website.  -Oh, just the website?"
"I mean, there's some video stuff,  but tech industry pieces mainly."
"Cool, tech. Tech's awesome. Tech's--"
So where have you been so far?
Travelling around the map  like Indiana Jones?
-Yeah.  -Where the adventure line
goes zigzagging all over the place.
"Yeah, actually, I'm almost done. Uh..."
"But I started off, flew into Sydney,  went to Thailand."
"-Oh, jealous.  -India. Yeah."
"Did Rome, went to Rome."
-Did the whole Europe vacation.  -Even I haven't done that.
"-Oh, really?  -Mm."
It was awesome.  I went to Pamplona in Spain.
-Is that Where they do the bull runs?  -Ran with the bulls.
-You Ran with the bulls?  -I Ran with the bulls.
-That's how I got this.  -Look at that!
You really are Indiana Jones.
Have you got your whip in your bag  and your hat?
I saved the world from the Nazis.  That was pretty cool.
"I, you know, just... trying to do,  you know, shit I've never done before."
"Is that what you're doing on this trip?  You're, like, finding yourself?"
"Yeah, um... in a way. I mean, I--  [stammers]"
Really to get away from the family home  is what I'm doing.
Oh.
"Yeah, that was-- Whatever, that's boring."
"Yeah, well,  I'm afraid Britain's pretty tame"
as far as daredevil opportunities go.
"Yeah? It's alright, it's the last leg  of the trip anyway so..."
I'm... unfortunately home next week.
-Not much time--  -Next week?
-Yeah.  -That's not very long.
"-No, it's not.  -Mnh-mnh."
So... I could use some suggestions  on fun shit to do.
-Hmm. Fun shit to do?  -Fun shit to do.
[groans] Ow! Ow!
[laughs] Jesus!
Hello.
-Good morning.  -Good morning.
Oh. Another battle scar.
[laughs] Kind of.
"Let me guess, you were, like,"
"[American accent] totally shark fishing  in Cape Town, dude."
[laughs]  Is that your best American accent?
"-Yes.  -That's pretty good. No, um..."
"It was courtesy of Josh Peters,  high school dick."
He and I got into a fight in shop class.
"And he hit me with this,   like, metal rod thing."
-What an arsehole.  -[laughs]
[posh English accent] What an arsehole.
-That's terrible.  -I'm sorry.
-[phone vibrates]  -Is that you or me?
"Oh, it's gotta be you."
"""Mom."" You're so American."
"Yes, I am."
Are you not gonna get that?
"Okay, that was a little impersonal."
"What, you wanna talk to her now?"
-You wanna talk to my mum? I'll call back.  -Fair point.
[laughs]
I don't think so.
[clears throat]
You hungry?
"Wow, look at all these games.  You're, like, a gamer. Cool."
Of course I am. For my job.
"What, a girl never beat you  at Street Fighter?"
"Is this--  Like, this is, like, your dating manual?"
[laughs]
What? The Singularity?
It's when computers learn to outsmart man  like women did years ago.
Oh! Wow!
"See, what I was doing, it was like a joke."
-You know?  -really?
"-Yeah.  -Well, that's what you call a joke?"
"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys have those."
"-You guys have those here, right?  -Yeah, Yeah. We do at the moment."
Ow!
That was a good joke.  That was a good joke.
Enjoy your Marmite.
"Whoa! Oh, my... [laughs]"
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?
"-Okay, alright.  -[phone vibrates]"
"Alright, saved by mum."
The best way to actually just stop her  from calling is...
"I don't know, answer it."
"Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms  I just don't wanna open right now, so..."
"She's worried. You're her son.  You've been travelling,"
"and I just think if you speak to her,  then..."
"Yeah, well, I still live at home  with her back in Syracuse."
-That's cool. That's fine.  -Yeah.
I was taking care of my dad.
"Oh, shit. Is he...?"
"-...okay?  -No, he died."
"-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.  -Last year. No, it's okay."
It was coming for a while.  It was early onset Alzheimer's.
"Oh, that must have been really...  uh... tough."
"Yeah, he was my best friend."
Sometimes he'd just look at me  and wouldn't even know who I was.
"Well, my mum, like, I don't even--  I don't know how to talk to her."
"You know, I don't have that connection.  I don't even know where to start."
So that's why I left.  That's why I went on this trip.
"Just to get away and make,  you know, all the memories that I can..."
while I can.
And I know I gotta talk to her  and I gotta just... [laughs]
"But not on this.  You know, I just-- I'll deal with it."
"I'll deal with it when I get back,  you know. I'll just..."
[kisses]
"You're a good guy, Cooper."
Call your mum.
[beeping]
[exhales]
[machine beeps]
"Zero, zero, one, nine,  three, nine, two, nine."
"No, I did not buy a pair of sandals  in Koh Samui last night"
because I'm in--
And how long does that take?
Because I need to buy a ticket back  to America.
[groans]
"Oh, my God."
Mm-hmm.
[sighs]
[groans]
"Can I just say, this is the most blatant  cover story for a second hook-up ever?"
"Yes! Yes! Oh, my God.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."
Alright. Don't forget your bag.
"The bag, yep, my bag.  Alright. You are a top bird."
"I don't know what that means, but I heard  somebody say it once, and you're it."
I got a plan. [laughs]
Yeah. It's odd jobs.
"-For who?  -For, like, it's an app."
"You can kind of-- like, I've used it  all over when funds were low, so..."
"-Oh, there's some interesting ones.  -Pretty cool."
"-""Thrillseekers wanted.""  -Ooh."
-This looks right up your street.  -Okay.
"Okay, four pound signs.  That's a biggie. That's good."
It's a little out of town.
And some kind of play test deal  for a company called Saitoo...
Saitogoo...
-SaitoGemu?  -SaitoGemu. Yeah.
They're huge.
-They're really big.  -Really?
-Horror games?  -Uh...
"Have you heard of...  Oh, what's one of theirs?"
"-Harlech Shadow.  -Harlech Shadow? Yes, I have."
I used to play that in my buddy  David Ludwig's basement
"when we were, like, seventh grade."
"Well, that's Shou Saito. It's his company."
"-He's like this genius, super secretive.  -Okay."
"And apparently,  they're working on this new project."
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.  But nobody knows anything about it.
"Well, maybe if I play my cards right  I can get you an exclusive with Shou."
Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?
[laughs]
You should take a photo.
"Seriously, if you get a photo  of anything that they're working on,"
that's a fuckload more money  than four pound signs.
Cool.
"Well, where is this place?"
[door opens]
[woman] Mr. Copper.
"Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper."
"Mr. Cooper, I apologize."
Just Cooper is fine. [laughs]
"Then, in that case, I'm just Katie."
-Hi.  -Hi.
"-Follow me.  -Oh, Yeah."
-I'll just get my pack here.  -Rav will take care of that.
"Oh, Rav will take care of that.  Okay, great."
That's good.  I don't wanna carry it anyway.
Rav kind of reminds me  of like an end-of-level boss.
"You know, haiukon. Just..."
-How was your journey?  -Great. Thanks.
-the car pick You up okay?  -Yeah.
[Cooper] Wow.
This way.
Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.
Wow.
[Katie] Come on.
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.  [laughs] Hope I get Gryffindor.
I'm gonna need your phone and anything  else you might use to send and receive.
"-A little paranoid, don't you think?  -Can't be too careful."
"Okay, there you go."
"Wow, you really are paranoid.  Whoa! [laughs]"
It's white.
Um...
"Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,  I agree to have my kidneys harvested?"
"Actually, it's a pretty standard  NDA-disclaimer thing."
Okay.
It's important that you realize there  is a small medical procedure involved.
"Sorry, for a game?"
"Nothing permanent  and we don't harvest your kidneys,"
-I promise.  -Okay.
It's no more invasive  than having your ears pierced.
"""Confidential information, brain downloads  the game, duration, termination..."""
Um... The signature page...
-Where do I sign?  -Oh.
-Signature. Yeah.  -There's a page missing.
-Okay.  -just A moment.
Alright. I'll just wait... here.
[door locks]
What the fuck?
[camera clicks]
[door unlocks]
-All good?  -All good.
What we're working on is an interactive  augmented reality system.
-like VR?  -More like layers on top of reality.
Oh.
-Okay. Um...  -[beeping]
Ow.
[whistles]
Um...
-What's that?  -We call this a mushroom.
-like Mario Brothers?  -If You like.
"-You're qualified to do this, right?  -I haven't killed anyone yet."
May I?
Yeah. [laughs]
[drilling sound]
All done.
"-That was it?  -See, I told you I'm good."
"-No, don't worry, it's not permanent.  -Um..."
"Okay. What is this, like, some kind of  memory test or something like that?"
"-You'll find out.  -Oh, okay."
You might feel a slight twinge  as it initializes.
"Oh, okay."
Commencing at 5:38.
"-You ready?  -Yes, sir!"
[beeping]
[beeping]
-Nearly there.  -[loud static crackling]
[phone vibrating]
I thought I turned that off.
-All done. You feel okay?  -Uh-huh.
Feel great.
-Watch the targets.  -Okay.
Um...
[electronic whoosh]
[Cooper laughs]
Is--
-What do you see?  -[laughs]
-[squeaks]  -Like a-- um--
[laughs] Like a video game gopher.
-Is it More detailed now?  -Yeah.
"Yep, yeah."
-And now?  -Holy fuck!
Holy shit! He-- Fuck. He's right--
He's right-- He's right-- Can I--
-[electrical crackling]  -Whoo!
He's not real.  He's a sort of mental projection.
-You can see him. I can't.  -You can't?
"-Wow! Oh, okay.  -[squeaks]"
Give him a whack.
"Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright."
[squeaks]
-[laughs]  -[squeaks]
"Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole."
-Mm-hmm.  -I've played it a million times. Okay.
Alright. [clears throat]
Here we go. Come on up.
[squeaks]
Oh! Where you coming up?
[laughs]
No. No.
-No.  -[squeaks]
[banging]
Oh!
[mutters]
[laughs]
Oh!
-[squeaks]  -Alright. Stay down.
Oh! Okay. [grunting]
Good game. Very good game.  You are so adorable.
"-Okay, bye. Bye.  -[squeaks]"
-Is that it?  -Afraid so.
Oh.
"Now, were the gophers  two-dimensional or three?"
"Three.  No, no, no. 3D, super 3D. Like-- Yeah."
-Now This Is just A limited test demo.  -that was A demo?
I think you should beta test  the full experience we're working on.
"There'd be more money in it, of course.  If you're game?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game."
-This is Shou Saito.  -Oh! [laughs]
-You must be our latest volunteer.  -Hi.
-This is really great. Hi.  -[speaking Japanese]
[speaking Japanese] Hi.
"I just-- I wanted to say  that the mole game, super fun."
Super fun... fun.
[speaking Japanese]
-Fun?  -Fun.
-Fun Is good.  -Yeah. Oh.
-Playing games Is good.  -Mm.
Your heart goes faster.
-You smile.  -Yeah.
"Yeah. Or, um... scream."
Oh! [laughs]
I have always liked  to make the player jump.
"Frightened. You get scared, you jump."
"-Afterwards, You feel good.  -Yeah."
You glow.
Why?
"Oh, um..."
Because of the adrenaline rush.
-Yes.  -Yeah.
But mostly because you are still alive.
You have faced your greatest fears  in a safe environment.
It is a release of fear. It liberates you.
"Yeah. I mean, totally."
What we are working on now
is the most personal  survival horror game in history.
[laughs] Cool.
One that works out how to scare you  by using your own mind.
Whoa. That-- [laughs] That sounds crazy.
-[beeping]   -Can't wait!
[Katie]  I'm uploading a neural net package.
"Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm."
"Name could use a little work, I think.  It's all 90s."
"I'm just kidding, it's a good name."
It's state of the art  intelligence software.
It learns and adapts on the fly.  It'll monitor your brain activity
and try and work out how best  to frighten you
and then adjust  to your experience accordingly.
-Whoa!
"-Are You ready?  -Oh, Yeah."
"-Beam me up. here We go, lock And load.  -Eyes closed."
-time Is currently 6:17 p.m.  -Okay.
"It's uploading.  Five, four, three, two, one."
[Katie] How are you feeling?
Um...
I feel good. I feel normal.
"Okay. Stand up, slowly."
[laughs]
Are you ready to play?
[Cooper]  Isn't this the Harlech Shadow house?
[Katie] It's part of the estate.
"The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.  But, yeah, this was the model."
The layout was replicated for the game  and the texture scanned.
-Wow!  -[Katie laughs]
"[Cooper] Very, very cool."
[door clangs shut]
"[Cooper]  So what's the game, what do I do?"
[Katie] You don't have to do anything.
"You just stay in here alone,"
see how long you last  until you're too scared to continue.
"[Cooper] So all I have to do is,  like, stay here?"
And I get paid for that?
"I'll be back in the control room,  watching."
"There are cameras all over,  so no stealing the silverware."
And now there's this.
-And what's this?  -It's an earpiece.
Oh!
"Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I  will be in contact the whole time."
"Oh, cool."
"And I can, like, talk to you,  and you'll hear it? Great, that's great."
"Now, nothing you'll see  can physically harm you."
"It's all just audio-visual,  like the gopher game."
"Oh, okay."
"But if it does get too intense,  we can pull you out at any time"
-And stop the experiment.  -Okay.
Is there a safe word you can think of?
Something easy to remember in distress?
"How about the word ""stop""?"
"-Good choice. ""Stop"" it is.  -Yeah."
"Okay, we'll leave you  to enjoy your evening."
-Alright.  -You'll hear from me in a moment.
Just make yourself at home.
"Okay, all right. Well, take her easy.  [laughs]"
[door clangs shut]
[door locks]
[clears throat]
[snaps fingers]
Harlech... Shadow.
[chuckles]
[coughs]
[whistles]
"Is this real? Yeah, it's real.  That's real. It's really dead."
[whistles]
"-[Katie] Cooper.  -Oh, hey."
-Are You hearing me?  -Loud And clear.
Oh!
"Reaching for the Dutch courage already,  I see."
[sighs]
-I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.  -Lame.
"-Well, We need You with A clear head.  -Okay. Fair point. Fair point."
This is high-quality craftsmanship.  This is nice.
Yeah. It's good woodwork.
-That's this place.  -Full marks for observation.
Mm-hmm! Yep!
[sighs]
[Cooper grunting]
[panting]
"Alright, there we go. [sighs]"
[sighs]
Ah!
"-Oh, shit.  -What's up?"
I just forgot I don't have my phone.
"I keep going for it,  I forget it's not in my pocket."
"And there's, uh... no TV here, so..."
"Welcome to the 19th century.  No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi."
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.
Probably were just bored out  of their gourds.
"Well, that's the leading theory  about ghost sightings."
The mind plays tricks  when less stimulated.
"Fewer distractions,  people saw more ghosts."
Isn't that a nice piece of info?
[both chuckle]
"Well, they got literature, though."
"That's pretty sweet, right?"
"Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual  last time that I read a book."
To think people used to do this  on purpose.
I know. Crazy. Why? [laughs]
"-You know, I don't think I've--  -Shh, alright?"
I need to get into some old-school  shit here. Concentrate.
[laughs] Pardon me.
Can I point out your heart rate  just increased?
"Yeah. Well, it should have  cos there's a huge crazy spider. [laughs]"
You see a spider?
-You don't-- you don't see that?  -No.
Don't-- Don't walk. Don't--
Holy shit!
"Tough guy like you, scared of spiders."
"Yeah, I'm just not fond of them."
It's worked out you're  an arachnophobe quickly.
It's probing for weak spots.
God damn it.
Fucker!
[crunch]
Yeah! [laughs]
Um...
Okay.
"Yeah, well, yeah."
Whole lot more realistic  than the gopher game.
It's good. It's good graphics.
"It's good, uh-- Yeah."
Weak sauce.
[electricity crackling]
-What is it?  -Just--
Nothing. Nothing.
Here with the figures. There's a--  No. There's a light on...
"now, in the..."
Can you... zoom in and--  zoom in on it?
And you can see what I'm talking about.  Whoa!
-Cooper...  -And now there's-- Shh!
There's a guy in the window.  That wasn't... [laughs]
-Yeah.  -[cracking sound]
And now he's gone.  Now nobody's in the window.
-Which is the--  -[creaking]
Mm-hmm. [laughs]
"Yeah, there's a--"
[footsteps]
Just leaky pipes.
[metallic banging]
"I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like--"
-Holy fuck! [screams]  -[cage rattles]
[screams]
Fuck!
[screams]
[laughs] Oh! Oh!
Okay. [laughs]
-That got me. You got me.  -[laughs]
-[laughs]  -What are you seeing?
Like a creepy fucking guy.
"Wow, just..."
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.
-It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!  -Sorry?
You're Josh Peters from high school!  From a guy I know at high school.
The system could be mining some  of your personal memories for texture.
Was Josh Peters  someone you were scared of?
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.
"I wasn't scared of him,  but he was a bully and--"
Man! Take a couple of Krav Maga classes  and I'd be ready.
I'd be ready! [grunts]
[grunts]
Kali ma! Dah!
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.
"I'd offer you some, but I don't think  you can drink it so... [laughs]"
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Catch ya later, Peters."
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.
"I'm not like a expert or anything,  but it's kinda great."
"I was in France.  I stayed at this, like, vineyard,"
"and they had this wine,  like, grape-stomping festival."
"Now that,  that wine was good. I know that."
You're being discursive.
-What Is discursive? discursive?  -Talkative.
-Mm-Hmm.  -Rambling.
[laughs] Is that a problem?
People sometimes talk more  when they're afraid.
Helps compensate for the fear.
"-Masks it, too.  -Oh, yeah?"
Similar to when you've got the TV on  late at night.
The voices make you feel less alone.
Even though you are alone.
"You aren't scaring me, Katie.  [laughs]"
Pity.
Is there like a refrigerator here?
-There's some snacks in the cupboard.  -[door creaks]
"Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney..."
Mo! Alright.
"Okay, ginger snaps."
Let's see.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do."
Now... um...
"He's gonna be right behind this door  when I close it, isn't he? [laughs]"
"Yeah, that's how this works."
[laughs]
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old--
[screams]
Fuck!
"Oh, God."
-What the hell Is that?  -What do You see?
[shudders]
Holy shit!
A fucking-- Uh...
Hard to explain.
It's like a huge-ass spider with a face  and dicks coming out of his mouth.
It's...
Peters. Peters is inside.
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.
"Ah, Katie!  Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?"
-I think that's all you.  -[groans] I'm so fucked up!
God! Fuck!
"Holy shit, you're fucking gross."
-[Katie's voice distorted]  -Yeah--
"Sorry, can you say again?"
"Katie, hello?"
"Damn it, Katie!"
"Whenever you come back online,  just say the word."
"No, I'm not scared, just... bored."
[loud knocking]
That you guys?
[loud knocking]
Coming to fix the earpiece?   That's probably a good idea.
-[loud knocking]  -Yeah. Yeah.
[loud knocking]
"-[groans] Fuck it, man!  -[loud knocking]"
[loud knocking]
Come on!
You're in danger.
Sonja?
[door closes]
"Now we're talking.  Alright, this is incredible."
This-- very impressive.  I am thoroughly impressed.
I am-- Wow! Wow!
"You look so real.  You're, like, just like her."
"I mean, wow."
Except... you're just unfortunately not...  um...
"-Cooper, What Are You doing?  -Wait, wait. Hold on, Hold on."
"-Cooper, you're in danger.  -Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think."
You're fucking real.  You are real. You're real.
"-Cooper, you're in--  -You're Sonja. You're actually here."
-Are you actually here right now?  -I'm real. I'm actually here.
-God.  -And We have to go.
-You have to listen to me.  -How Are You here?
You know that photo that you sent me?
I dug around and apparently  Shou Saito took out a patent
for a computer brain interface last year.
How are you real? I don't--
"Okay, fuck. I don't--"
They brought you here! [laughs]
"You are, you're real,  and they brought you here,"
"and they're trying to fuck with me.  Nice try, good try."
I get it. It's part of the test.
"His patent got rejected outright.  They said it was insane, it was dangerous."
Wow. Really? How much are they paying you?  Honestly. Cos you're killing it right now.
"-have they given You something?  -Sorry, I thought You were fake."
"But now I know you're real,  I'm being a really terrible host."
I got some non-alcoholic wine.  Might put us in the mood.
"-Cooper, what I want to do is--  -We'll talk about it in the kitchen."
"-Cooper!  -Sonja, relax, okay?"
"Give it up.  I know, the jig's up, okay? Let it go."
"Look, Cooper, there's more."
Five people have disappeared  in the past year.
"All tourists, all registered  with that stupid odd jobs app."
"Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy."
"Whatever they're doing to you,  whatever they've done to you,"
"it's dangerous,  and we really have to go now, Cooper."
"[laughs] Okay, okay. Alright."
"-Well, if your story's true...  -Cooper."
-then how'd you find me?  -What?
How'd you know where I am?
"It's a games company,  I looked up the address."
"Yeah, really?"
"No, no, no, no.  How'd you find me here? This place."
-I tracked you.  -You tracked me?
"Yeah, with your GPS on your phone.  Find My Friends."
"Find My Friends? That would've worked,  but they took my phone."
"And it's in a building, like, a mile away.  So, yeah, nice try."
That's right. [laughs]
So much for women outsmarting men.  Singularity that!
"Look, all I'm saying is that"
"I think that you could've come up  with a better story,"
it could have been funny or...
"Okay, alright, don't be pissed."
Do you ever wonder  how your bank account got hacked?
What are you doing?
-I cloned your card as You were asleep.  -Whoa. Okay.
Put the knife down.  What are you going to do with that?
I drew your attention to this job.
"Sonja, put the fucking knife down, okay?  It's not funny."
"Should've called your mum, Cooper."
"-But You called me, And I led You here...  -Sonja."
-You know what?   -...like a breadcrumb trail.
"Put the knife down. Drop the act.  Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja."
-It's not fucking funny. Put the knife--  -[knife clanks]
"This isn't what I signed up for.  I'm fucking done, okay?"
-Fuck!  -[screams]
[screams]
What the fuck? [screams]
[groans]
[Sonja screams]
"Oh, fuck! Oh!"
[groans]
[gasps]
[groans]
Holy fuck!
[both grunt]
[screams]
Stop!
[groans]
[wails]
[groaning]
[wails]
-[Sonja yells]  -[screams hysterically] Fuck!
[screams]
[both grunt]
[both scream]
-[ripping sound]  -[screams]
[screams hysterically]
[roars]
-[screams]  -[roars]
[screams]
[stabbing sound]
[screams]
"Oh, fuck! [cries] Oh, fuck! [screams]"
[cries]
[gasping]
[whimpers]
-[Katie] Cooper.  -[screams] Katie!
-Katie!  -Cooper.
"-Katie!   -Cooper, what's happening?"
What the fuck happened?
What's happening? We've been talking.  You've not been responding.
-You said I wouldn't feel anything!  -What are you seeing? What's there?
-Fuck! She's gone now.  -Who's gone?
"Oh, my God, I-I felt it."
There's a knife in my arm!
"-In my shoulder.  -Cooper, who was there?"
-Fuck... Sonja.  -who?
"Sonja. She's this girl that I know,  that fucking-- She stabbed me."
"-She had A fucking knife.  -Nothing can harm You, Cooper."
"-No, no, no, no. She was solid.  -No, she can't have been."
She-- I was stabbed! I would know!
Nothing you see can harm  or even touch you.
It's purely audio-visual.
"-There's no physical sensation.  -Fuck! Yes, there was!"
"-Cooper, You need to calm down.  -I know because I felt it, okay?"
"I felt her arm, it was warm,"
and I felt her fucking stab me  in the shoulder.
"-That's not possible.  -[sighs] Oh, my God."
"-It's not possible, Cooper.  -Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!"
Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.
"-Unless, I mean...  -Oh, God. Unless what?"
"I don't know. The neuron net,   it could have maybe worked out"
"some means  of replicating physical experiences,"
-But that would be unprecedented.  -Jesus Christ.
"Okay, you know what? Stop the game."
I want out. Just pull me out now.
"Stop, stop, stop.  Safe word. Fucking stop!"
"-Okay, Okay, just let us work it out.  -Oh, God."
"No, I want this fucking thing out now."
"Cooper,  do not attempt to remove that yourself."
Removing it yourself  is extremely dangerous.
"-[screams]  -Stop that, that could kill you!"
Just stay calm!
-[Shou speaks Japanese]  -Is that Shou?
Is that Shou? What's he saying?  What's he saying?
"Okay, Cooper.  We're gonna commence with deactivation."
"Oh, that's great news."
We need you to follow instructions  and make it to the access point.
The access point? Great.  Where the fuck's the access point?
"-Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!  -Just one more level."
-Trust me.  -[sighs] Okay.
-[groans]  -Left at the top.
"-Okay, Which door?  -Room at the end."
[panting]
What is it?
There's gonna be something behind there.  I can feel it.
-Something like...  -like what?
Some personal fucked-up shit.
"Like... I don't know, I could feel it  digging around in my head."
"Cooper, get to the door."
"It's gonna be like my mum,  I don't know, dead."
-your mum?  -fucking swinging from A fucking beam.
-Your mother is not in there.  -You're not in control of this!
It's in my head.  It fucking knows. It knows.
-It knows!  -It knows what?
It knows I got this thing with my mum.
"Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there."
"-Now open the door.  -Oh, my God."
It's the only way I can get you out.  Listen to me.
"Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay."
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.
"But I can't get you out  unless you open that door, Cooper."
Okay.
Would you kindly open the door?
Here we go. Here we go.
[breathes heavily]
[sighs] Okay.
"Okay, okay, I'm in the room.  Where's the access point?"
Access point?
-there Is No access point.  -what?
[Katie laughs]
"I'm fucking with you, Cooper."
I told you to come up here  to see if we've broken you enough
to obey instructions without question.
"-And We have.  -Oh, No, No, No."
"Katie, come on.  Katie, come on, let me out!"
"Katie, let me out, come on!  What the fuck!"
"Oh, what are you gonna do?  Oh, what are you doing to me?"
-Why are you doing this?  -You thought you'd see your mother.
"-Oh, fuck!  -What does she look like?"
[stammering]
"Your mother, can you describe her face?"
Her hair colour?
She--
"Is she tall, short, fat, thin?"
-Where did you grow up?  -She--
What's your favourite band?  Your favourite flavour ice cream?
The name of the girl who stabbed you?
"You don't know any of these things,  do you?"
Don't you think that's odd?
It's fucking taking my memories!
"Overwriting them, technically."
[gasps] Fuck.
Look in the mirror behind you.
Do you recognize yourself?
Do you even know who you're looking at?
Soon you won't be anything.  You'll be just like your dad.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
"-That's what really scares you, isn't it?  -Stop it."
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  -You're going the same place he did.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
-You're going nowhere.  -Shut up! Shut up.
[voice echoes] You should have called mum.  She's all that's left.
"-You abandoned her.  -No, no, no, no!"
Get out of my head!
You'll never see her again.  You'll never speak to her again.
-Never see her face.  -Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!  Get out of my fucking head!
You're a bad son.  You'll never see your mother again.
-You're going nowhere.  -[wails]
Straight into oblivion.
You deserve it.  You should have called her.
Get out of my fucking head!
[screams]
Get it out of my head!  Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my fucking head!
"Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?  I just need to connect."
Get it out of my head!
[screams] Get it out of my head!  Get it out of my head!
"Oh, my God. [wails] Where am I?"
[speaking Japanese]
[Katie speaking Japanese]
-Who are you?  -[Katie speaking Japanese]
-[Cooper sobs]  -I can't stop it.
[sobs]
I don't know who I am.  So I-- So I need to go home.
The interface has data tendrils  like roots.
They've dug in deeper  than they're meant to.
"Threaded through your brain,  taken over whole areas, I can't stop it."
"I can't remove it, and I can't stop it."
[whispers]  But I-- But I don't know who I am.
I don't know-- I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.
"On behalf of Saito Game Team,  I most humbly apologize."
[weak voice] Who are you?  What have you done to me?
"-What have You done to me?  -Put him with the others, please."
"[wails] No, no, no, no! No, no, no!"
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!  Stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!  No, don't, don't!"
[screaming] Don't! Don't!
Stop! Stop!
[high-pitched whistle]
No!
"Oh, fuck. [gasps]"
That was one second.
Either he's super susceptible to this  or the software is way too powerful still.
It's jumped from zero to 18K  in five milliseconds...
"[Shou] I'm sorry. The experience was  more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper."
I hope you can forgive us.
[man] ...all luggage under the seat  in front of you.
All electronic devices  should now be turned off and stowed
as they may interfere with the aircraft's  navigational and communication....
[laughs]
[door opens]
Mum?
[sighs]
[woman sobbing]
[sobs]
Mum?
I have to call him.
Mum?
Why did Cooper go?
"-I--  -Mom, I'm right here. I'm--"
"-I'm right here, Mum.  -I have to call Cooper."
I have to call  and make sure that he's safe.
I have to call him. I have to call him.  I have to call him.
[sobs]

-What happened?  -His phone rang.
"-You didn't take it off him?  -Yes, but..."
-the signals interfere.  -I know I switched it off.
Maybe he did something  while I was out of the room.
An oversight. Won't happen again.
The incoming signal must have interfered  with the upload sequence.
[sighs]
Every synapse in his brain lit up at once.
Then went dead. Like that.
You said he shouted something.  What was it?
"""Mum."""
-Make A note of that.  -Yes.
"Oh, mama liked the roses"
She'd grow 'em in the yard
But winter always came around
And made the growing way too hard
"Oh, mama liked the roses"
And when she had the time
She'd decorate the living room
For all us kids to see
When I hear the Sunday bells
Ringing in the morning
I remember crying

Kenny?  Big spillage on table four. Sorry.
[woman] Okay. All right.
Excuse me.
Someone forgot this.
"[woman] Oh, thank you!"
-What do you say?  -Thank you.
-It's all right.  -She forgets everything. Thanks again.
"She was some yoga teacher, proper bendy.   Look. Look."
"Jesus! Fuck!  What, she sent that to you, did she?"
[man] Double naughty.
Jog on.

[muffled pop music playing]
[groans] Linds!
"Linds, where's my laptop?"
[pop music playing]
-Don't be a bell end!  -Use your own.
-Mine's bust. Yours has gone all frozen.  -What did you do?
-I was trying to put on this film thing.  -What film thing?
Don't know. Some programme  lets you watch free films.
"While I was trying to put it on,  then it locked up."
"-Look, it's not my fault.  -Don't take it again. It's not yours."
"-Oh, fix mine when you've done that.  -""Fix mine when you've done that."""
-Stop nicking my Cokes!  -[Linds] Whatever.
"Did you draw that yourself, Kenny?"
[camera shutter clicks]
"Thanks, Kenny. See you tomorrow."
Bye.
"-[mimics] Bye, Kenny.  -Bye, Kenny, I'll see you tomorrow."
[muffled rock music playing]
You're mental.
-You're mental.  -You're a thief.
Love? Kenny? What do you think?
-I'm still not used to the colour.  -[Kenny] It's nice.
Yeah?
"Do me a favour  and prison-guard your sister, will you?"
I won't be late. Probably.
-[both laugh]  -[phone chimes]
"Oh, my God! He's outside.  There's a lasagna thing in the freezer."
I love you.
"[door opens, closes]"

So many ladies  and the music playing loud

"-Morning, Kenny.  -Hi."
[phone chimes]
-Kenny?  -Feeling really sick.
-You've only just got here.  -I know but think I might throw up.

-It's fragile.  -What is it?
[camera shutter clicks]
They told me to do that.
"[""send"" alert plays]"
Is that it? What do I do now?
[alert sounds]
I can't really help you.
What do I have to do?
"Just whatever they say  and once you've done that, you're out."
They let you off.
[phone chimes]
-[panting]  -[distant siren wailing]
[woman chattering]
[muffled coughing]
[man] Hello?
Del-- Delivery.
[man] Wrong room.
They said 121.
"[man] No, there's no delivery here."
-But they said--  -[man] I haven't ordered anything.
It's a cake.
-[man] What cake?  -I don't know. I think it's a sponge.
[man] I didn't order a cake  so just take it back to the bakery
"-and tell them they got it wrong.  -Look, if I--"
[man] I don't want the cake.  So go away or I call the front desk.
[man] I will kick that cake  up your fucking arse.
M-Mindy sent me.
-What is this? Where's Mindy?  -I was just told to give this to you.
-Mindy told you?  -No.
"-You said ""Mindy.""  -That's what they told me to say."
[door closes]
[man] Get inside.
[door closes]
So what are you saying?  Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?
"No, uh, I don't know.  It-- they-- it was them."
Them? They? Who the fuck are you on about?
-The people.  -What fucking people?
The phone people.  The people on the phone.
"They told me to bring the cake,  and they're leaving texts on my phone,"
"-and then I do What they say.  -Whoa, whoa. Slow down."
Just breathe through your nose.
-[breathes deeply]  -Through your nose. Okay?
"Good. Now, just show me what they said.  On your phone."
"-Show me The text.  -Okay, well, um... This."
-I should--  -Shut up. Just let me.
What the fuck is this?
-Who are these people?  -I don't know.
-Who are you?  -I'm not them.
"They send me messages,  and I do what they say."
Why? Why would you do that?
[alert plays]
[alert sounding]
Is it them?
[man retching]
[breathes heavily]
[toilet flushes]
[camera shutter clicks]
-They said I had to do that.  -Jesus Christ!
[alert sounds]
"Okay, okay."
"They're saying they just need us  to follow their instructions,"
and everything will be okay. Okay?
Shit!
They're saying we have to do it  together.
-What do we have to do?  -Just take The cake somewhere.
They sent me an address.  A map coordinate thing.
-And there's a car we need to get.  -A car? What sort of car?
I don't know what sort of car.  They said it's in the car park outside.
They sent me a licence plate.  That's all I know.
Why both of us?
I don't know!
"Just let me deal  with my fucking shoe, please."
[phone chimes]
[man] What have they said?
"They say, ""Go with him. Take the package."""
Okay.
"""V760 DHM."""
V760 DHM.
I'm getting fucking number blindness here.
That's it.
All right. They said  the keys are on the back. Okay.
[exhales]
"Look, maybe you better drive.  Do you drive?"
"-I mean, I had a drink back there.  -I can't. I can-- I can drive."
I'm still learning.  Haven't passed my test yet.
All right. Uh... You're navigating.
"Okay, you've got a sat nav  on your phone?"
Yep.
Here it is. Punch that in.
It's a street somewhere out of town.  Sort of High Wycombe-ish.
They said we got to be there by two.  It's gonna be tight.
[starts engine]
So I'm guessing they got some shit on you  that they're threatening to put out?
"With me, it's..."
"You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers."
I was waiting for a prostitute.
"Escort, hooker,  whatever they call them now."
"I got a family, which is great."
You get bored.
"I mean, when I was young,  I used to like..."
I can't fucking justify it.  I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.
"For old times' sake, I don't know."
I joined this website. I was curious.  Just wanted to see what was on there.
"I got talking to Mindy,  who I thought was Mindy."
"I mean, she sent me pictures.  I sent some back."
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.
You name it.  They got the whole fucking thing.
"But not just pictures, chat messages.  All the arrangements, where and when."
Me haggling over the price  and they say they got it all.
Sucked up the whole hard drive  like an audit.
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!
"If that shit gets out,  that's my wife out the door."
"Then there's the kids, she'll take them."
"Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind  she'd take them and she'd win."
"Custody, she'd win."
And I'm not losing my kids.  I tell you that right now.
No way! Absolutely fucking no!
[sobs]
They filmed me.
-Filmed you...  -Through my computer camera.
"-What, like, Filmed you?  -Yeah, like, you know, doing it."
"-like sex?  -No. like, you... you know."
Jerking off.  Jerking off to porn or something?
"Well, everyone does that."
-The fucking pope probably does that.  -They're gonna put it everywhere.
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.
"-Oh, shit the fuck!  -What? What?"
-How long's that light been on?  -What light?
"Whoever's car this is,  they left it fucking empty."
I won't be a minute.
Unleaded. Unleaded.
"Oh, bugger!"
"Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time."
Have you got any money?
"Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.  Say that back to me."
-Visa card--  -Just the number!
"-Uh... 3109.  -Okay, go!"
[man] Pump four!
[chattering]
-What's your pump number?  -Four.
-you want some chocolate?  -No.
-It's two for one this week.  -I'm okay.

-Okay.  -Keep It non-dairy Just to be safe.
Okay.

Nice to meet you.
-Kenny.  -Kenny. I'm Karen.
We're both Ks. [laughs]
"I'm head of the PTA at Theo  and Cassie's school, for my sins."
Just roped poor Hector into sorting out  the catering for the quiz night.
Been the usual balls up.
"Listen, we better get this guy  to the station."
His train's... So we better go.
-Cansroad Station?  -Yeah.
"Oh, couldn't drop me  at the end of my road, could you?"
It's on the way. Mayer Street?
It's the bus otherwise and that goes  all the way around the common.
"-We're in a bit of a rush, actually.  -Well, it's no detour. It's en route."
I'll hop out.  Hardly need to slow down. Yeah?
-Yep. Sure. Let's go.  -Brilliant. Thanks!
I'll just get in the back.
"Oh, don't want to squash your box."
-What's that? Present?  -It's a cake.
"-It's just a-- it's a cake for Penny.  -Oh, lucky her."
So how is Penny?
Haven't seen her since...  must have been sports day.
She's good.
-She still planning to get back to work?  -Yeah. Yep.
[phone chimes]
"-[Karen] I mean, how old's Theo now?  -Uh... He's seven."
He was so funny in the play.  That big top hat on.
"Yeah, he had a good time."
"[Karen gasps]  Oh, Anna's having a sleepover."
Cassie's probably already told you  about it.
Six nine-year-olds in the house.  I must be mad! [laughs]
[phone chimes]
"So, Kenny, where you heading back to?"
-Sorry. What?  -are you going home or...?
-Uh...  -Train. Birmingham.
Yeah. Uh...
"-Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.  -Oh, my husband's from Birmingham."
-What part are you?  -South.
[Karen] South.
-Mainly.  -Right.

Have you always lived there?  'Cos you don't sound--
"I don't have the accent, no.  Everyone says that--"
that... I don't have the accent.

Didn't grow up there though.  I grew up somewhere else.

We-- We can't. We--
"Then how else are we gonna deal  with this, Kenny?"
-I'm not--  -Listen to me.
-I'm not--  -Shut up and listen!
Hat and sunglasses.  No one's going to ID you.
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.  That's point one.
"Shut up! Point two,  in a robbery, staff are trained."
I am not--
They are trained to hand over the cash.
No argument. I saw it in a documentary.  No resistance. It looked easy.
It's not easy.
"I know it isn't easy, but what the fuck  else are we gonna do? Hey?"
"This gets out, I will lose my kids."
"And I swear to God,  I will stand in the kitchen"
and put a fucking bread knife  through my throat if that happens.
-I only looked at pictures and--  -and beat one off on camera?
"That's what they got, yeah?"
"Your hot little face, blurred fist,  dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?"
"Your mum's gonna love that on Facebook,  Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever."
"And her friends.  All eyes on you, giving it that."
"Toss in the cunts at work,  calling you Spurty McGoo."
"Laughing at your come face,  making it their desktop wallpaper."
It's not just weeks.  We're talking years here.
Pictures hang about on Google  like a gypsy fucking curse.
There's no cure for the Internet.  It would never go away.
"It'd be glued to your name,  a fucking stain on you."
I'd hang myself if that was me.
Crack my fucking neck  at the first opportunity.
"They just want the money,  so go in there and do it."
-You'll drive away.  -I am not gonna drive away.
I'm gonna be sat here  with the engine running.

Just give me money!
-Yes. Okay.  -Lots of it. I need Lots of it.
Sh-should I use your bag?
Take it.

There was some bloke standing there  on his phone freaking me out.

I figured they were   kind of a fashion statement.
-Really?  -But then the rest of your outfit is not.

I never did anything like that.
All the more reason.
"Oh, you're nice."
-I can't.  -Okay.
-I just... I can't.  -I get it.
-I have to go.  -In this?
It's been really great to meet you.
Likewise.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Shit.

"-I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?  -No, don't do that. Just..."
-then stop this.  -can you hear me out? Please? Please.
How many girls do you think there are  in San Junipero?
Hundreds? Thousands?
I don't care.
"I'm saying there's plenty  of other girls out there for you, Wes."
The locals? They're like dead people.
-[whooping]  -A little lively for dead people.
"Look, I don't want some kind  of boring romance, okay?"
"Like, Jesus,  put us in a retirement home deal."
"Well, if you're looking for someone  to fuck, there's options."
-Hang out at the Quagmire again.  -It's not just sex.
"-It was just sex.  -no, we made a connection."
"Wes, it was just sex."
-no--  -no roots.
We had fun.
I'm sorry.

-I don't know how to do this.  -Do what?
Just help me.
Can you just...
Just make this easy for me?
You wanna get in my car?
[engine revs]
-How long have you been here?  -Sorry?
-How long have you been here?  -In San Junipero?
Uh... Couple of months.  Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.
"Guess I'm a tourist, like you."
Yeah.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah.
-[horn honking]  -[screams] Stop!
[tyres screech]
[thuds]
[both pant]
"Sorry, but..."
"[laughs] Man, your face!"
[laughing]
Wow.
-You like it?  -It's just so big.
Reminds me of where I grew up.
Miss your mom?
[moaning]
[gasps] You have to show me.
-Okay.  -Okay.
You never slept with a woman before?
"That's not a critique.  I mean, it was fucking awesome."
"No, never with a woman."
Never with anyone.
Not anyone?
"-What, In town or...?  -no. no one, nowhere."
-I guess you deflowered me.  -I deflowered you?
What is this? Merry England?
[laughs] Shut up.
You've had relationships though.
Mnh-mnh.
Hello! You got a fianc.
"-It's complicated.  -Yeah, I'll say."
When did you know...
-that you liked women?  -I like men too.
Equal rights.
Okay.
But when did you know?
Do you always know?
"I was married to a guy.  A long time, I was married."
I always knew.
"I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls,"
"co-workers, friends,  some waitress that served me."
"They were crushes.  God, they were crushes."
Never acted on any of it.
Never did anything.
I was in love with him.
I really was in love with him.
But he chose not to stick around.
So now it's me.  And I'm passing through.
"And before I leave,  I'll have a good time."
I'm just gonna have a good time.
Time's nearly up.
Then let's lie here.

-How would I know that?  -You're her friend.
-was a friend.   -Has she been here?
No.
"[laughs] You too, huh?"
Well...
Hey. Try a different time.
"Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time."
"She's worth the shot, right?"
Introducing the totally redesigned  Chrysler Cordoba.

Why are you here?
I was looking for you.  Where did you go?
I like a change of music.
How the hell is this your era?
"-you hid from me.  -one, I did not."
"Two, I owe you zero.  And three... see point two."
It's not about who owes who.  It's about manners.
You don't know who I am.
You don't know what this means.
This means fun.
Or it should. And this...
"This is not fun, okay?"
This is not fun.
So you don't feel bad?
Maybe you should feel bad.  Or at least feel something.

Uh...
"Oh, jeez."
Hey.
Please tell me  you got your pain slider set to zero.
"Yeah, I think so."
"-Okay, listen.  -How many of them are dead?"
Like what percentage?
As in full-timers?
[Kelly] Eighty. Eighty-five.
I'm sorry.
"-I'm not gonna jump.  -I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's..."
"In the time I've been here,  I said I wouldn't..."
"I don't know, do feelings."
You freaked me out.
I don't want to like anyone.
So you've been just...  totally fucking inconvenient.
It's that...
I don't know how long there is.
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.  For wanting something--
[sighs] Next week it is.
I'm getting married.
Next week?
-To nice Greg?  -[laughs]
-Sure you're going through with that?  -I have to.
-you have to?   -Mm-hmm.
He really is a good guy.
"I mean, my family don't approve, but..."
they can't stop us.
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.
-But that's not fair 'cause he's...  -[shushes]
You said you don't know  how much time there is.
What does that mean?
They tell me three months.
It's spread basically everywhere.
They said three months before  six months ago.
"So, you know, what do they know?"
Doesn't even taste of anything.
-But so you'll stay here after?  -No.
"When I'm done, I am done."
But that's cra-- I mean...
-Why?  -Richard.
That's...
My husband's name was Richard.
He died just two years ago.
So we had the opportunity  to stay in San Junipero.
Pass over.
Didn't take it.
-Didn't want to take it.  -Why wouldn't anyone take it?
He had his viewpoint.
"There were things he believed   and things he didn't believe in,"
and this place was one of them.
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.
Shit.
I didn't know if I wanted to try it  but... I mean...
"Jesus, without this place,  I never would've met someone like you."
"-Yeah, you could have.  -No, I wouldn't."
-we could have Met outside all this.  -no.
You... would not have got me at all.
At all.
"If we really met, I mean..."
"If we really met, you wouldn't like me."
Try me.
Or you'd--  You wouldn't want to spend time with me.
-You'd come and then--  -Try me.
Why?
Why? What's the point?
What? Where are you? Houston?
"Carson City, Nevada."
So come on.
I showed you mine.
Where are you?
"-I can just Look It up.  -Santa Rosa, California."
-That's no distance.  -I don't want you to--
-I don't want you to see me. I'm scared--  -And I'm dying.
Whatever you are can't scare me.
Let me come visit.
I want to say hi.
Here you go.
You okay?
[man over loudspeaker]  Please check in at our self-service pods
using swipe cards provided.
-you must be Kelly.  -I guess I must.
-She's waiting for you.  -Thank you.
-Please.  -[beeps]
She won't be able  to physically respond in any way.
But she can hear you.
I'll give you some privacy.
"[whispers] Hello, stupid."
It's good to see you.
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?
It is.
-I'm Greg.  -You're Greg?
-Holy shit.  -[laughs]
"Yeah, I think it's great  that you came down here in person"
before she passes over.
Even her folks  don't come visit no more so...
She's passing over?
-When?  -Uh...
-Let's go grab a coffee.   -Okay.
"-She didn't tell you?  -No, she did not."
-Said she was just visiting.  -More like sampling the trial version.
"I mean, I've only known her  the past three years."
We talk on the comm box.
She told you how she ended up  quadriplegic?
And how long she's been that way?
"One night, she's 21,  comes out to her folks."
"They're a little uptight about it,  you might say."
They told her they don't  want a gay daughter.
It's not natural and so forth.
They fight. She gets in her car.  Runs it off the road. Boom!
-When she was 21?  -More than 40 years back.
"It's been her whole lifetime, basically."
So the whole San Junipero system  has been a big deal for her.
The biggest deal.
"Of course now, until she passes over,  it goes permanent,"
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.
I guess you're the same.
They ration it out.  They don't trust us with more.
"They say you go crazy  if you have too much, you know?"
You don't leave your seat.  You disassociate body from mind.
Like that doesn't happen  in every senior home already. [laughs]
"The system's there   for therapeutic reasons,"
immersive nostalgia therapy.
Plunge you into a world of memories.
"Helps with Alzheimer's,  that's what they say."
Small mercies.
So...
About this marriage...
The state's got a triple lockdown  on euthanasia cases.
"You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,  the patient, a family member."
It's to stop folks from passing over just  because they prefer San Junipero flat out.
"Anyhow, Yorkie's family,"
"they're big-time religious,  and they will not sign."
But a spouse can override them.
-Hence the wedding bells.  -you got it.
"We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,"
and then she's scheduled to pass  tomorrow afternoon.
"""Scheduled to pass.""  Let's just call it dying."
If you can call it dying.
"Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven."
I guess.
You gonna wear a suit?
[laughs]
The ceremony's on my coffee break.
"I never married so I just figured,  you know, what's the harm?"
You're a good man.
"It's the least I could do, right?"
Think you could hook us up  to the system now?
"Just for a little while,  before she passes?"
"You can still see her afterwards.  I mean, then she's no limit."
"She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan."
"I know, but can you?"
"Seriously, it is so tight here  that they monitor every--"
I only want a moment.
[Greg] Ma'am.
-you got Five minutes  -Thank you.
Hey!
I've never been here  during the daylight.
It's warm.
"Listen, I gotta be quick.  So I spoke to Greg."
Oh.
-You're passing over tomorrow?  -Yeah.
Couple of hours after the wedding.
So I guess I am technically  honeymooning here forever.
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you.  -[shushes]
-I'm gonna say something crazy.  -Okay.
Wanna marry me instead?
"It's just... Greg seems great, but..."
-Why not someone you've connected with?  -[laughs]
-[laughs] Is that a yes?  -[laughs]
"[man] ...to be your lawfully wedded wife,"
"to have and to hold,  in sickness and in health,"
"in good times and in woe,  for richer, for poorer..."

That's it.
[Kelly coughing]
Are you sure you're all right?
[beeps]
[sighs]
[horn honks]
Hey!
[both laughing]
You didn't dress up to see me?
Oh...
Come on!
-Better?  -[both laugh]
Whoop!
Oh!
Oh! Whoo!
[Yorkie] Looks so real.
It feels so real!
[Kelly laughs]
[laughs and screams]
"-What are you doing?  -Oh, I love it here! [laughs]"
I just love it.
-You've been here before.  -But now I live here!
Be with me.
-I'm with you now.  -That's not what I mean.
Pass over.
-When it's your time.  -Yorkie.
-Stay here with me.  -can we just enjoy tonight?
It's almost midnight.
"In ten minutes, you're out of here."
Then I gotta wait a week  to see you again.
"-You know I'm just a visitor.  -What, a couple of months, then what?"
-We're not discussing this.  -Then you're gone.
-just gone. you could have forever.  -Forever?
-Who can even make sense of Forever?  -However long you want then.
"I mean, you can remove yourself  like that. [snaps fingers]"
It's not a trap.
"I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!  [bangs vehicle]"
-I'm going.  -Hey! Oh. Hey.
It's real.
This is real.
And this.
-Hmm?  -Come on.
You know that was just a gesture.
-you married me.  -to help you pass over.
-As a... kindness.  -It's not so kind to leave.
"Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just..."
I got this chance.
We got this chance.  I wanna share it with you.
I said I made my choice.
What is it? You feel bad  because your husband isn't here?
-Because that was his choice.  -Don't.
He chose not to stay here.  It's like he left you.
"You know, he could have stayed,  but he chose to leave you."
-You don't know what you're saying.  -You should be mad at him.
-not whipping yourself with guilt.  -Get off me.
"You can't see it!  But what he did, it was selfish actually!"
[gasps]
Forty-nine years...
I was with him for 49 years.
You can't begin to imagine.
You can't know...
"the bond, the commitment, the boredom,"
"the yearning, the laughter,  the love of it."
The fucking love. You just cannot know!
Everything we sacrificed.
The years I gave him.  The years he gave me.
Did you think to ask?
Did it occur to you to ask?
We had a daughter.
Alison.
"Always difficult, always beautiful."
"Died at 39 years old, bless her heart."
"And Richard and I,  we felt that heartbreak as one."
"You think you're the only person  ever suffered, go fuck yourself."
"-Well, I didn't know--  -Didn't think to."
"You know, when he was dying,  Richard said to me"
"when they offered him this,  to pass over, pass through,"
"spend eternity in this fucking graveyard  you're so in love with,"
"he said, ""How can I?  When she missed out, how can I?"""
And so he went.
"And I wish I could believe he's  with her now,"
"that they're together, but I don't."
I believe they're nowhere.  Just like you said.
"Gone. No, I pitied you,  and that's the truth. I pitied you."
Now you give me some sales pitch
about how fucking peachy forever  could be.
I'm sorry.
You wanna spend forever  somewhere nothing matters?
End up like Wes?
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire
"trying anything to feel something,  go ahead."
But I'm out. I'm gone.
"Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!"

"-you all right?  -Yeah, I am fine."
[wheezes]
"-Well, Okay then.  -Huh?"
Kelly?
All things considered...
I guess I'm ready.
For what?
For the rest of it.
[seagulls cry]
[starts engine]
"Ooh, baby,  do you know what that's worth"
"Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth"
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on Earth
"Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth"
When I feel alone
I reach for you
- And you bring me home   -[honks horn]
When I'm lost at sea
-[laughs]  - I hear your voice and it carries me
Ready?
- In this world we're just beginning   -[both] Whoo!
To understand the miracle of living
- Maybe I wasn't brave before   -[both] Whoo!
But I'm not afraid anymore
"Ooh, baby,  do you know what that's worth"
"Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth"
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make a heaven a place on Earth
"Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth"
[beeping]
Heaven
Heaven

"In this world, we're just beginning"
To understand the miracle of living
"Baby, I was afraid before"

"Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth"
"Ooh, heaven is a place on Earth"
[glass cracks]
"[woman] Okay, my people!  Rise and shine. Get up, Stripe."
[banging]
Hey. You awake yet?
-Sure as shit ain't dreaming no more.  -[woman] Company!
"Something went down last night  in Her Falls,"
a village about three miles east.
"We've got reports of a food store  broken into, shit stolen."
Locals think it's roaches.
[woman] Roaches!
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!  [claps]
"Hey, so, it looks like you're getting  your first real-live roach hunt, huh?"
[laughs]
[clamoring]
"Hey, new!"
New!
It's Stripe.
Here's a little tip just in case  you get your first toe-to-toe
-with one of them roaches today.  -Uh-huh?
"When you see one right here,"
try not to shit your pants.  It's only gonna piss them off.
-I'll try.  -Try to ignore Len.
"His aim's so bad,  he's the only guy on Earth"
who could shit his own pants and miss.
"-Fuck you, farm girl.  -farm girl?"
[woman] Yeah. Hunting's in my blood.
-Some of us are naturals.  -[engine starts]
Moving out!
Whoo! Yeah!
-[baby crying]  -[chickens clucking]
[soldiers speaking Danish]
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay."
-You can speak now.  -[robotic voice interpreting]
[speaking Danish]
"-[machine] It must have been roaches.  -Roaches, you see them? You see?"
-[speaking Danish]  -[machine] I didn't see them.
[machine] I heard them.  All the mess. It must have been them.
-Want a cookie?  -[man speaking Danish]
-Here you go.  -[machine] They've been in the food.
[speaking Danish]
[machine] We'll have to destroy  everything they left.
No one will eat it.
"[woman] We can replace that, okay?"
[machine interprets]
[man speaking Danish]
[machine] They destroyed the cooler.  Broke it and took the parts.
The cooler?  They stole parts from the cooler?
[machine interprets]
-Which way did they go?  -[machine interprets]
[speaks Danish]
[machine] There were footprints  in the dirt leading that way.
-Parn Heidekker.  -[machine beeps]
-Parn Heidekker.  -[machine beeps]
-Heidekker? Is that a name?  -[machine interprets]
"Stop them coming. Please, you must stop."
Okay.
I have child who is scared.
I will. I promise.
[whispering in Danish]
[woman] Stripe!
[whispering continues]
Okay. Our friend here thinks  that the roaches
went in the direction  of Parn Heidekker's place.
"Local oddball, seems to be some kind  of religious freak."
"Anderson, Hague, I want you  to stay here and help them torch the food,"
keep them calm and reassured.
"The rest of you,  we're gonna drop in on Heidekker."
"Ask some questions,  sniff around the place."
"If there's roaches,  we show we're ready for them. Let's go."
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly  what you call a socialite or a mingler.
Seems like mental health issues.
"He's got some interesting views  on roaches, by all accounts."
I'm putting his info  in your Mass system now.
Been complaints lodged against him  going months back.
"Locals claim that he let roaches  cross his land, left food out for them."
Could be just shit talk  from the local villagers though so...
"Yo, how many roaches  we got left out here?"
"A couple of thousand?  A couple of hundred, if that?"
"I mean, back home we had millions, man."
It only took two years  to get shit back on track.
Out here you got rustic fucks  throwing them scraps.
No wonder it's taken so long  to mop shit up.
But how can anyone be dumb enough  to help a fucking roach?
"Hell, yeah."
[whirring]
Portals front and rear.
Windows blacked out.
Chimney smoke. Someone's home.
"Lennard, you use the boomer."
[cocks gun]
[cocks gun]
"Okay, Mass check. Everyone got the layout?"
-[woman] Check.  -[man] Check.
Check.
"[woman] Aikin, Valcon, Coach,  you check the outbuildings here."
Take them one at a time and slow.
"Stripe, Raiman,  you come with me and Lennard."
We go in here.
"Len and I will talk to Heidekker,  you check the rest of the house."
Okay.
"Optimal outcome, no shots fired."
Except on a roach.
-[woman] Except on a roach.  -[laughs]
[lock turns]
"-[woman] Morning, sir.  -[machine interprets]"
There's no need for this.  I speak your language.
Okay.
-What Is it you want?  -Just to talk.
That's what we're doing.
Be a little more neighbourly  if we did it inside.
Check the upstairs rooms.
[woman] Relax. I'm not your enemy.
Where are they?
Where are who?
"You know, we got a whole bunch"
"of frightened, angry people  in that village."
"Roaches have been breaking  into the food stores, stealing supplies."
You know anything about that?
No.
"[woman]  See, it's not just what they stole."
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.
-No one's gonna eat it.  -[whispers] Stripe.
[woman]  Makes life harder for everyone.
Cross on the wall there.  You got principles.
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.
I agree. All life is sacred so...
you even got to protect the roaches.  Right?
It's not their fault they're like that.  They didn't ask for this.
I get it. We get it.
-[door bangs]  -Mm-hmm.
-[door bangs]  -[bird squawks]
[woman] There's shit  in their blood that made them that way.
The sickness they're carrying.
That doesn't care about  the sanctity of life
or the pain  about who else is gonna suffer.
"We don't stop the roaches,  in five, ten, 20 years from now,"
"you're still gonna get kids born that way,  and then they're gonna breed."
Bingo.
[woman]  And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.
"That sickness,  and it could have been avoided."
Fucking roach nest.
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.
"[woman] Every roach you save today,"
you condemn God knows how many people   to despair and misery tomorrow.
You can't still see them as human.
"Understandable sentiment, granted,  but it's misguided."
We gotta take them out if humankind  is gonna carry on in this world.
That's just the hard truth.
Gotta make sacrifices.

"You can run around, even put me down"
[speaking foreign language]
I'll still be there for you
[woman] Rai!
We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday School  all the way back to base?
You can cover your ears.
"Yeah, or, uh....  I'll just hit permanent mute."
[woman] Lower your weapon.
"[Raiman]  Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?"
"[Stripe] He's a civ, right?"
"You shoot a civ, that's gonna stay  with you the rest of your life."
"Yo, Stripe, why don't you, uh...  pull the stick out of your ass?"
"Because I'm fucking with him, not you."
"I guess I had you both going, right?"
All right!
Let's torch the place.
[high-pitched whistling]
"[Raiman] Hey, you okay, man?"
Yeah.
[bird squawks]
-I heard you popped one in there.  -Two.
"Wait, two?"
"-I got another one, with my knife.  -[laughs] With your knife? Holy shit!"
"-Pretty good, right?  -Yeah, you fucking Terminator."
"Damn! First time out, he gets two."
"[man] You lucky motherfucker, man."
Sweet dreams for this asshole.
[Raiman] Gonna get a treat tonight.
[Raiman] Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
[echoes] I love you.
[breathes heavily]
[rattling]
-[rattling]  -[high-pitched whistling]
[breathes heavily]
-[gunshot]  -Whoa! Miss Sharp Shooter.
Patronising fuck!
Ruthless! You're the Grim Reaper.
"Yeah, well, no roach gets away next time."
Are you still sweating that?
"Well, I grew up tracking deer.  You never give up."
I don't like it when they get away.
Nice.
"Yeah,  if that fucker made it to the forest,"
"probably made it to the border,  gone for good."
Yeah. It's all right for you.
You popped two of 'em.
It's been a while for me.
"You know, the gal is getting twitchy."
"Come on, Rai."
You sleep good?
"Yeah, I slept OK."
"What, that's all you're gonna give me?"
"Okay? You know, if I got two in one go,"
I would want to come for like an hour!
"All right, shut up. [groans]"
All right.
Ah! That's the way.
-[high-pitched whistling]  -[gunshot]
[grunts]
"[Raiman] Hey, you okay, man?"
"Yeah, think I'm tired is all."
"Uh-huh?  All right, so you did have a good night."
[scoffs]
[basketball bouncing]
"[woman] 39, 40, 41...."
42...
"43, 44, 45, 46,"
"47, 48, 49,"
"50, 51, 52,"
"53, 54, 55,"
"56, 57, 58, 59..."
[high-pitched whistling]
[panting]
[woman] Strong and pure.
Strong and pure.
[groans]
[soldiers chant]
"-Hey, Stripe, you okay?  -Yeah."
"I mean, I... don't know."
I feel a little off.
"I mean, I ain't sick or nothing.  It's just, uh..."
Report to the sick bay.
[man] Running diagnostic.
What do you see?
A cube.
[buzzing]
-Rotating?  -Yeah.
-And now?  -a tree.
-Like an apple tree.  -Touch the apples for me.
Full marks.
"-So you say you had Like a headache?  -Yeah, but Just quick."
"Nothing big, just..."
"Well, everything looks okay."
No sign of any malfunction  or dropout with your Mass implant.
"And physically,  you're in exemplary shape."
"You've just seen combat,  you can expect some sort of side effect."
"There was this, uh... this thing..."
with a light on it at the farmhouse.
-Roach had it.  -a Roach had it?
-Kind of Like a flashlight.  -Flashlight?
Kinda.
I don't know.
"Seriously, you're fine. Your Mass is fine.  Blood's fine. It's all fine."
Okay. Yeah.
[sighs]
Maybe you should speak to Arquette.
Who's Arquette?
"So, you must be Koinanchey?"
Koinange. Folks call me Stripe.
Why would they call you that?
"Couldn't pronounce Koinange either,  I guess."
[laughs]
-That's funny.  -Thank you.
"At ease, son. Sit down."
So you recently logged your first kills?
-Two roaches?  -Uh-huh.
First time out. It's impressive.
"Yeah, I guess."
So what happened?
"-What, with the kills?  -Mm-hmm."
"Oh. I'm in this, uh... farmhouse."
"There's this, like,  hidden room or something."
We go in and there they are.
"First one, I just... It was automatic.  Just pop-pop, you know?"
Right. Just like in training.
"[Stripe] Yeah, just like that, yeah. Yeah."
"-And the second?  -I mean, he was on the ground with me."
[Arquette] He?
It was a he.
Oh.
"So, this was close quarters then?"
"Yeah, he's on top of me.  Struggling, I mean..."
I couldn't reach my rifle  so I had to stick him.
Stick it. With my knife.
And how did that... feel?
"-What, like...?  -Emotionally."
"I didn't. I mean, it was quick.  It was self-protection."
"I guess all I felt was, you know, relief."
-Just relief?  -Uh-huh.
It's not unusual to experience  other feelings too.
A moment of euphoria even.
"Yeah, I guess."
"I don't know,  I thought maybe I'd feel..."
I don't know.
"-Something else?  -Yeah, like..."
"Regret. Something like that,  but that just wasn't there."
Hmm.
So you'd do it again?
"Yeah, sure."
So... why are you here? [laughs]
I don't know. I mean...
I had a few weird moments.
My Mass looked like it was glitching out.
"But your implants,  I mean, they passed every diagnostic."
"-There is nothing wrong with that?  -Yeah, they said it's fine."
"I don't know, I think I just..."
Felt like something was up with it.
-But there's not.  -No.
[both laugh]
You did a big thing.  You should be proud of yourself.
Okay?
It'll pass.
"Let's get you a good sleep tonight, huh?"
A real good sleep.
[echoes] Fuck me.
[breathes heavily]
[moans]

"-Way to go, fuck fingers.  -[scoffs]"
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent  too long once we got to work on him.
"He's given up a location, someplace  the roaches have been scavenging."
"[Raiman] Well, all right."
[woman] It's a housing project  that's been empty since the war.
It's not far from here.
So control wants us to do recon  before we go back to base.
Can we hurry it up here?
"We ought to burn the whole forest down,  huh?"
Give those roaches nowhere to run.
[whirring]
"Okay, you see that?"
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.
And there are some cables.
-There's got to be roaches leaching power.   -Why here?
[high-pitched whistling]
Christ knows.
All right.
Better dial it in.
[groans quietly]
[groans]
Control. This is Medina.
Positive ID. Signs of activity here  at the housing project location.
"Sighted one solar panel, looks  recently wiped clean and some cabling."
-Roger so far.  -[sniffing]
-you all right there?  -Smell the grass.
We can't usually smell nothing.
"-You ever noticed that?  -[Raiman] No, I never noticed that."
[Medina] Requesting course of action.
Didn't read. Please repeat.
Okay.
Control says we should fall back  and await comm--
-[gunfire]  -[Raiman] Shit!
[gunshot]
Medina.
[gunshot]
-[gunshot]  -Oh!
Medina. [panting]
"Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!"
[Stripe whimpers]
Okay. Ready? Cover me.
"Rai! Rai, come on."
Okay.
[whirring]
"Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.  Jesus Christ."
Fuck. Piece of shit.
"Okay, Stripe."
"Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude."
"He fired six shots.  His rifle looks old, bolt action."
-Should take him ten seconds to reload.  -We go in?
We go in and take him out.  Are you with me?
-I'm with you.  -Let's go!
-[gunfire]  -Follow me!
"[Raiman]  Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me."
[high-pitched whistling]
[groans]
[breathes heavily]
"[Stripe groans, panting]"
"-[gunshot]  -Come on, man! What the fuck?"
[breathes heavily]
What the fuck is this shit?
Let's go.
[Raiman] Stripe!
[breathes heavily]
[door creaks]
"-[screams]  -Whoa, whoa! It's okay. Hey. Hey."
-[wails]  -Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.
It's okay. It's okay.  I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?
"-Go on, get out of here. Go on.  -[panting]"
It's not safe. There's roaches here.
[panting]
Go on. Get.
[panting]
[gunshot]
[gun cocks]
[Raiman] Come on!
"-Rai, what did you do?  -[Raiman] Shut up! Come on!"
"What did you do, Rai?"
[breathes heavily]
[panting]
[gunshot]
[Raiman] Got ya.
[door bangs]
[animal-like roaring]

-[screaming]  -Rai!
-[screaming]  -[gunfire]
-[gunfire]   -[screaming]
[breathes heavily]
[speaks Danish]
-[woman] No!  -[yells]
-Run!  -What the fuck are you doing?
-You're killing them!  -They're roaches! [yells]
"You're fucking killing them, Rai!  Fuck you!"
"What the fuck's wrong with you, man?  You got some blown shit."
-Pull it together!  -No.
[groans]
-[gunshot]  -[groans]
[panting]
[groans]
[panting] Are you all right?
You gotta get out of here. Come on.
Come on!
[gasps]
[grunts]
Fuck!
[breathes heavily]
You better run.
[wincing]
Shh. Shh.
[groans]
[wind blowing]
[both gasp]
[groans]
Here.
I'm all right.
[panting]
You see me as I am.
Of course I see you.
You don't see roach?
You ain't a roach.
Roaches is all...
Fucked up?
Roaches don't speak.
You just can't hear us.
-What the Fuck are you talking about?  -Your implants. Your army implants.
The Mass system?
"They put it in your head to help you fight,"
"and when it works,  you see us as something other."
"One of us, Luka,  was making a... a machine."
Light flashes.  Said it can interfere with the implant.
You're roaches?
But I've seen roaches.
"I've seen them, they're fucking...  They're like, uh..."
"-Animals?  -No, they're monsters. I've seen them."
The implant made you see this.
[groans]
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?
"The locals, they... they ain't army.  They got no Mass in their heads."
They're scared of the roaches.
-they hate the fucking things.  -Everybody hates us.
"Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?"
"The fucking civs, when they look  at a roach, what do they see?"
What you see now.
They hate all the same  because it's what they've been told.
[cocks gun]
[panting]
[birds squawking]
"Ten years ago, it began."
Post-war.
"First, the screening programme,   the DNA checks,"
"then the register,  the emergency measures."
And soon everyone calls us creatures.  Filthy creatures.
Every voice. The TV. The computer.
Say we have... we have sickness in us.
We have weakness. It's in our blood.
They say that our blood cannot go on.
That we cannot go on.
My name was Catarina.
He was Alec.
Now we're just roach.
But now...
Now you see me.
Now you see me.
Rai?
"-Rai, no!  -[gunfire]"
-[gasps]  -[gunfire]
[panting]
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.
"-None of it's true, Rai.  -What the fuck got you?"
None of it's true.
[spits]
-Fuck you.  -[thud]
Get up. Back against the wall.
Get up!
You want me to come in there?
[Arquette]  It's all right. I can just talk to him.
[door opens]
"Thank you, Briley."
[door closes]
Stripe.
We owe you an apology.  We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.
I got you a coffee.
"The device you found in the farmhouse,  you mentioned it to the doctor."
Is this the thing?
We found it on an old block  that you and Raiman were searching.
Looks like they reverse engineered it  from some of our drone parts and so on.
The light here transmits a code.  It's like a virus.
"It burrows into your Mass,  trying to shut it down from within."
"I tell you, those roaches  are getting more ingenious"
than we give them credit for.
The whole thing is a lie.
"I understand why you'd say that, yeah."
Roaches.
They look just like us.
Of course they do.
That's why they're so dangerous.
"Humans.  You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,"
but we're genuinely empathetic  as a species.
"I mean, we don't actually really want  to kill each other. [laughs]"
Which is a good thing.
Until your future depends  on wiping out the enemy.
"Come on, sit down."
[groans]
I don't know how much history  you studied in school.
"Many years ago,  I'm talking early 20th century,"
most soldiers  didn't even fire their weapons.
"Or if they did, they would just aim  over the heads of the enemies."
They did it on purpose.
British Army. World War I.
"The brigadier,  he'd walk the line with a stick"
and he'd whack his men  in order to get them to shoot.
"Even in World War II, in a firefight,"
"only 15%, 20% of the men  would pull the trigger."
The fate of the world at stake  and only 15% of them fired.
Now what does that tell you?
It tells me that that war  would have been over a whole lot quicker
had the military got its shit together.
So we adapted.
Better training. Better conditioning.
"Then comes the Vietnam War,"
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.
Lot of bullets flying.  The kills were still low.
"Plus the guys who did get a kill,"
"well, most of them came back  all messed up in the head."
And that's pretty much how things stayed  until Mass came along.
"You see, Mass...  Well, that's the ultimate military weapon."
It helps you with your intel.
Your targeting. Your comms.  Your conditioning.
"It's a lot easier to pull the trigger  when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?"
"It's not just your eyes, though.  Takes care of your other senses, too."
You don't hear the shrieks.
You don't smell the blood and the shit.
They're human beings.
Do you have any idea the amount of shit  that's in their DNA?
Higher rates of cancer.
Muscular dystrophy.  MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.
It's all there.
The screening shows it.
Is that what you want  for the next generation?
Don't feel bad about doing your job.
The villagers won't do it.
The folks back home won't do it.
They don't have Mass.
Mass lets you do it.
You.
You're protecting the bloodline.
"And that, my friend, is an honour."
There's no honour here.
It's just killing.
-Lying And killing.  -No one lied to you.
You knew all of this. All along.
What are you talking about?
You agreed  to have your Mass implant put in.
-[laughs]  -Set up. Every soldier does.
We can't just embed it and feed you  a dream. Your mind would reject it.
You have to accept it. Willingly.
It's exactly what you did.
[man] So you see the terms  and conditions there?
"Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man."
What is that?
That's your consent video.  From when you signed up six months ago.
"[man] Basically, it says you agree  to Mass implant activation."
"-I didn't do this.  -Yes, you did."
"-[man] Works kind of like hypnosis.  -Yeah, all right."
[man] Part of what you're agreeing to  is not realising
you've been put in this state.
If you follow me.  You won't recall this conversation.
"That's kind of funny, man."
Turn it off.
"-[man] So for you to register consent...  -Turn it off, man."
I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.
"-Right here?  -[man] Yes, please."
That's dope.
[faint beeping]
I didn't do that!
[faint beeping]
-I don't remember that!  -Just like the man said.
[beeping]
-I know you're upset.  -Fuck you!
"-What's happening?  -We control what you see, Stripe."
-I can't see nothing.  -Because we control it.
Give me my fucking eyes back.
"-Let me lay out your options.  -Give me my fucking eyes back, man!"
-[grunts]  -Let me lay out your options!
[breathes heavily]
"Option one,  you agree to have your Mass reset."
"All the recollections  of the past few days,"
"including this conversation, erased."
No way.
Option two's incarceration.
-I'd advise you to consider.  -Fuck you!
Mass is a friend.
"Without it, you will remember  everything that you did."
I ain't having this Mass shit.
No more. No way.
Okay.
Well...
Maybe you should see  what life would be like without it.
[beeps]
[Stripe] What's happening?
Where am I?
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.
"I have it all logged, Stripe.  We can feed you everything that you did."
"Hey, no, no, no. No."
Please! Please don't shoot. Please!  Please! Please don't shoot.
-Please! Please!  -No! No!
No. Make it stop.
-No! Please.  -[whirring]
Make it stop!
-Please!  -[gunfire]
No! No!
[gasps]
-[screams]  -[gasps] No!
[whimpers]
-[stabbing sounds]  -[screams]
Fuck off! Stop it!
-[stabbing sound]  -[groans]
-[stabbing sound]  -No!
You'll see and smell and feel it all.
Is this what you want?
On a loop? In a cell all alone?
[whimpers]
[beeps]
[Stripe whimpering]
[Arquette] We can make that go away.
This conversation goes away too.
All of it.
But you gotta say the word.
"Just say the word, Stripe."
And it all goes away.
[glass cracks]
[man] They're ready now.
[woman] Perhaps we could begin with  your earliest recollections
of the events of last May.
"Well, I first got involved on the 15th."
[woman] Could you move the microphone  a little closer?
[feedback whines]
Here?
I first got involved on the 15th.
[beeping]
[sighs]
[beeps]
[woman on TV]  Chancellor Tom Pickering has defended
the government's stance  on disability benefits
"as outrage over the death of so-called  ""Wheelchair Martyr"" Gwen Marbury grows."
"More than 20,000 people  have signed a petition"
demanding the sacking  of newspaper columnist Jo Powers
following her controversial article  about Gwen Marbury.
Conservationists have announced  another extinction.
The Siberian crane has died out
following an unprecedented reduction  in its wetland habitat.
And the honeybee-mimicking drone insects  known as ADIs
have been activated  for their second summer.
[buzzing]
[man] Hope you're ashamed of yourself.
-Bitch.  -Pleasure's all mine.
[phone beeps]
[keys jangle]
[van door opens]
Yo Powers?
Jo Powers.
"Whatever's in there, will it detonate?"
That's from bakery. For you.
-Thank you.  -Thank you.
[door opens]
"[man] Hello, darling!"
[chuckles softly]
"Creative, your well-wishers."
[man] Don't eat it.
It's a cake. That's its job.
I'm going to have a bath.
Sail away
"Sail away, sail away, sail away"
From Bissau to Palau  in the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree  and the Isles of Ebony
"From Peru to Cebu,  hear the power of Babylon"
- From Bali to Cali...   -[Jo laughs]
Ah!
[chuckles]
[woman on TV] Grammy-award-winning  rapper Tusk is still with us.
[cheering]
"Now, Tusk,  there are loads of online videos"
"of people trying to emulate you,"
but this is our favourite.  Take a look at this.
[laughter and cheering]
It's a young chap called Aaron Sheen.  He's nine years old.
[laughs] That is one goofy-looking kid.
-[laughter]  -Not a good dancer.
"He's nine years old!  Come on, he's a pretty good dancer."
That young motherfucker can't dance  for shit.
"He should probably just give up  now, actually."
Don't hate on me for keeping it real.
"That's a goofy little motherfucker,  and he can't dance for shit."
"[woman] He is a big fan, Tusk."
-[Tusk] Don't hate on your boy.  -[phone beeps]
[woman]  Everybody's got to start somewhere.
[Tusk] Start somewhere?  I looked better than that--
-DCI Parke?  -No press.
"No, I'm not press. Um... TDC Blue Colson.  I'm your shadow."
My shadow? They said--
Sorry. Call me Karin.
-Did you say your name was...?  -Blue.
"-B-l-u-e, Blue?   -Yeah. It's not a nickname."
-My dad liked the sound of it.  -Uh-huh.
-Seen a body before?  -a couple.
"-On video, I mean.  -[man] Boss?"
-This is Blue. She's my shadow.  -[helicopter whirrs]
-DS Nick Shelton.  -What've we got?
-Jo Powers.  -As in...
As in actual Jo Powers.
Saw something she wrote the other day  about the wheelchair woman.
Clickbait piece. Pissed people off.
That article was fucking horrendous.  Even I signed the petition.
To get her sacked.
Come on.
Neighbours heard her screaming  and called it in.
[Karin] Hell of a struggle.
Anyone else at home?
Husband. Found slashed across the stomach.
-By her?  -Don't know.
He was unconscious.  They've taken him to St. Columbus.
[Blue] Her mentions are still pouring in.
Restraining bolt's in place.
-No other points of entry?  -No. But the outside's ringed with CCTV.
-We got the code for the cams?  -Uh-huh.
"Okay, then. Check the recordings.  Bag that, send it to Toxicology."
"Full autop for her, and we question  the husband as soon as he wakes up."
Come on.
-You think it's the husband?  -I'm keeping options open.
"Cutting the throat, that's unusual.  Thanks, chaps."
-But you do think he did it?  -Don't know anything yet.
"These things are almost always  either drink, drugs or domestic."
It is how it is.
-you driving home?  -No licence. Never passed.
I'm sort of waiting for driverless  to go mainstream.
"-Get in.  -No, honestly, I'll get the Tube."
-Get in.  -Oh. Okay.
-So you were in Tech Crime?  -Digital Forensics. Computer murk.
"[Karin] What happened,  you get bored of it?"
Not exactly. You've seen  what people tuck away on these.
"Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.  It's not boring."
I'm old enough to remember  when they walked around with that stuff
just tucked away in their heads.
[Blue] Right. But now they can't help but  entrusting it to their little companions.
These things absorb who we are.  They know everything about us.
"[Karin] If it's interesting,  why leave Forensics?"
The Rannoch case.
"-Ian Rannoch?  -the child killings, Yeah."
I was the one  who cracked his souvenir folder.
-So you saw those pictures?  -Mm-hmm.
And the videos too. Saw them all.
"You see something like that,  it changes you."
You either get defeated or you think--
"You think, ""Fuck me!  I've got to help stop that shit."""
Yeah.
"-I mean, out here in the field--  -What fucking field?"
"You know what I mean.  Out here in the real world,"
"you can genuinely prevent stuff,  can't you?"
You are young.
Maybe you're old?
-[Karin] Steady.  -[chuckles]
Thanks.
"-See you tomorrow.  -Yes, boss."
[woman on TV] Jo Powers has been found  dead at her home in West London.
The veteran columnist had been  at the centre of controversy
over an article she'd written about  disability rights activist Gwen Marbury.
The police have yet to confirm the cause--
[clicks]
"[man] It's just the first floor,  first door on the..."
-Starting early?  -I asked Nick to show me the CCTV.
"-Oh, yeah?  -Yeah."
No one came in or out.   Just Jo and her husband all evening.
-And that one there?  -Rear patio.
-Bust for months by the looks of it.  -Someone could've come in through there.
"They'd have to climb the fence,  make it in and out,"
"knowing the camera wasn't working,"
"but yeah, could have happened.  Technically."
"Okay, sorry."
You're keen to help.
-She just asked!  -Uh-huh.
[sighs]
[sighs]
[Karin clears throat]
Um... So...
I'm collating every threat  or insult levelled at Jo Powers
over the previous 48 hours.
"Say it is the husband.  That's a coincidence, isn't it?"
Not really.  You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.
Stress levels in that household  would've been through the roof.
That Internet stuff  drifts off like weather.
"It's half hate. They don't mean it.  The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D."
That's had work put into it.  That's sincere.
-Yeah. I'm divorced.  -Um...
Husband's up and talking.  You're gonna love his alibi.
[siren wailing]
[phone rings]
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.
"And when I ran in, she was walking  'round the room, stumbling."
She was clutching-- She was clutching  her head as if she was in pain.
"And then for a moment, she stopped."
"And then it was like a seizure, she was..."
thrashing... clawing at her own skin.
And she turned...
[sobs]
"She smashed her head...  onto the desk, hard."
Then she-- she pushed me over.
That must've been when the bottle smashed.
"Then she picked it up,   and she started cutting herself."
Here. She was gouging.
[sobs] I tried to stop her.
But she did this.
Then she cut her throat.
I tried to stop her.
She cut her own throat with the glass!
[man whimpers]
[cries]
[Karin] Mutilated and then killed herself  for no apparent reason?
I'd say the odds are against that.
He said it was like  she was having a seizure.
Maybe there was something in the cake.
"-The cake?  -It had ""fucking bitch"" iced on it."
-Could've been something in it.  -Like a drug?
-I don't know.  -That makes people kill themselves?
He was sort of convincing.
"-He just doesn't seem the--  -Don't say ""the type."""
He's ordinary. That is the type.
"What, so he bounced her head off the desk?"
-Blue.  -Held her steady enough--
-Blue.  -What?
-Toxicology are looking at the cake.  -Okay.
"Meantime, let's drop in  on the person that sent it."
Got the name this morning.
-You don't need to patronize me.  -We're doing what you want.
-Following another lead.  -that you think is a waste of time.
"Picking along dead ends just  to prove they're dead ends,"
that's most of the job.
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.  Just...
you haven't had a chance  to get bored of reality yet.
"Okay, that was patronizing."
-Is this who sent the cake?  -[Karin] Uh-huh.
-Have we checked her social feeds?  -I don't know.
"""Death to Jo Powers.""  She posted that on Monday morning."
"The bakery said that they're  not meant to do obscenities,"
"so I said it was for my sister,  like just a joke thing,"
"and they agreed, so..."
"Not cheap, their cakes.  With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?"
"Um...  Well, I didn't pay for it all myself."
-We all put a pound in each.  -We?
Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers  message board.
I held a sort of whip-round.
"-you crowd-sourced the money?  -Yeah, if you like."
From 80 other people?
"Look, I'm not... [laughs]"
"I'm not being funny, okay?  I know she is dead."
But did you read what she had written?
How much do you think she got paid  for spouting that horrible shit?
I don't know.
-I was just using My freedom of speech.  -to send a threatening message.
"[scoffs] It was funny, okay?"
"And I can see if I'd done it myself,  then that would be a bit weird,"
but I'm not mental.
You wished she was dead.
"Well, uh..."
"[stammers] No, no, I didn't."
[phone beeps]
"-""Death to Jo Powers.""  -[laughs] That's just..."
"It's a-- a hashtag game, you know,  like ""Death to..."""
You insert the name  of someone who's being an arsehole.
It's not... real. It's a joke thing.
And who started it? The hashtag?
I don't know. I don't know.  I saw it somewhere.
[phone beeps]
Excuse us a moment.
Toxicology say the cake's clean.
"They also said:  ""Thanks, it was delicious."""
We'll give her a caution.  Offensive Communications Act.
"-Does that cover cakes?  -As far as she's concerned, it does."
"What about the others who chipped in?  Are you going to tell them off, too?"
-I didn't do anything.  -Start a thread about it.
Hospital's discharging the husband  tomorrow.
We'll bring him in for questioning.
Blue? We're arresting the husband.  Don't wallow in that.
The Internet will be pissed off  with someone else today.
[Nick] Tusk.
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk  'cause of that thing with the kid.
He's catching a shit storm  on social media.
-Liza will be organising the cake now.  -Yeah.
-See you tomorrow.  -See you.
-Whoo!  - Turn a penny to a grand
"When I'm ready,  rocking steady for my fans"
Where my ladies at?
"-Yo! Good show.  -Yeah, that's a good show, brother."
-I'm feeling my shit.  -You want some of that?
"-What you smoking?  -Good shit, boy."
A'ight.
Damn!
"Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on."
Don't stress. It's legal here.
"Pfft! Keep forgetting.  Welcome to Europe, I guess."
-Kinda takes the joy out of it.  -Tell me about it.
"-[clatter]  -Careful! You break it, you pay for it."
-Always doing some bullshit.  -[Tusk yelling]
-[screams]  -Tusk? Tusk?
[screaming]
"Yo, yo! We need some help over here!"
[screams hysterically]
-I got you.  -Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!
Call an ambulance!
[screaming]
[monitor beeping]
[typing]
-[whirring]  -Commencing.
[rattling]
[beeping]
-Did he say What It is?   -Nope.
[buzzer]
-Good morning.  -morning.
[man] She's in here.
"So I go in,"
and there's not just the wound  from the glass.
"There's a hole. Dug in.  A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel."
"So I follow it, you know,  how deep does it go?"
It goes all the way from her ear canal  to deep in her brain.
Where I find this.
Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.
-[Karin] It's one of those bee things.  -[Blue] An ADI.
An Autonomous Drone Insect  from the Granular Project.
-How did it get in there?  -I'd say it burrowed in.
-Fuck me.  -[man] That's not the worst part.
"It crawled right through  her dorsal posterior insula,"
which is basically  the brain's pain centre.
You're talking agony off the scale.
-You'd do anything to make it stop.  -Even cut your own throat.
-Good afternoon.  -DCI Parke.
-TDC Blue Colson.  -Okay. Thank you.
"[Karin] They're so fucking fancy-looking,  these companies."
"-Billions On branding.  -Well, they can afford it."
The whole ADI project's pretty much  bankrolled by the government.
It's why so many people  are paranoid about it.
"Let me guess,  this is some people on the Internet?"
They reckon the government  uses the bees to spy on us.
There's a schizophrenic world view.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
"Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself  living in the future,"
but here I fucking well am.
-Karin Parke?  -Uh-huh.
Vanessa Dahl.
Please. Follow me.
You're after information  on our Project Swarm ADIs?
[Karin] That's right.
[Vanessa] Any particular reason?
Yes.
[buzzing]
Rasmus.
Rasmus Sjoberg.
-he heads Swarm.  -Nice to meet you.
-Hi.  -Hi.
-Nice greenhouse.  -Yeah.
[buzzing]
"[Karin] So, your bees, your ADIs,  talk me through them."
Colony Collapse Disorder.   We still don't know what's behind it.
Bees themselves were virtually extinct
so what our ADIs do  is effectively stand in for them.
"They're solar powered.  They don't need nectar,"
but they pollinate flowers the same way.
"They crawl inside,  pollen sticks to their legs"
and gets brushed off  the next flower they visit.
-can they make honey?  -Uh... No.
I was joking.
How do they know  where the flowers even are? I mean...
"Well, they have a sensor."
Like a... camera?
No. Just a basic visual sensor.
"You see,  they need rudimentary pattern recognition"
in order to locate compatible flora  and navigate.
-they navigate?  -Yes.
You don't... I don't know... steer them?
"They're autonomous.  That's right, isn't it?"
They make their own decisions.  They look after themselves.
"Yes. You see, the ADIs  cover the whole of the UK."
We couldn't command each one  individually ourselves.
It's just not logistically possible.
No. [coughs] We simply  set the behaviour and leave them to it.
They even construct these hives  themselves.
They reproduce...
-they reproduce?  -Yes. Each hive is a replication point.
"-[Blue] It's like a 3D printer, basically.  -[Rasmus] Exactly."
"They create duplicates of themselves,"
create more hives  and spread out exponentially.
-[Blue] Cover the country.  -Maybe you should work here.
"Yeah, well, I read up on it.  It's impressive."
It is. It's just a shame it's necessary.
The alternative would have been  environmental catastrophe.
Bees were dying out.
"So, what is it that brings you here?"
We think one of your ADIs   may be involved in an unexplained death.
Sorry? A death?
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
"Yeah. It's one of ours.  But, look, these are not designed to..."
Kill people? I'd hope not.  Could it have malfunctioned somehow?
"No. I mean, when they do malfunction..."
"It happens, but then they just break,  they just hit the ground."
What if someone hacked one and then  they found a way of controlling it?
That's impossible.
"You see,  it's got military-grade encryption,"
"and you would need a diagnostic  controller, which is also encrypted."
So I would say the likelihood is--
"I don't know what he's saying,  but it's not the same as ""impossible."""
This is every hive we have online.
See...
These are the hives in the building here.
"-How many bees per hive?  -Around 4,000."
-[Karin] It's like air traffic control.  -[Rasmus] Yeah.
Is that the search input?
"-Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...  -Sorry."
[tapping on keyboard]
-Jo Powers' postcode.  -[beeping]
Is that who this is about?
"-you said you Get some malfunctions?   -a fair few, Yes."
They smack into a car or something.  We even had people trap them.
"You know, put them in the microwave  for YouTube videos. [laughs]"
And this logs  any that drop off the system?
"Logs everything, yes."
Did you lose any around here  on Monday evening?
"Well, I can check."
[beeping]
"Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.  Here, I can replay."
[beeping]
There.
-That's odd.  -[Blue] What's odd?
"When they pass between hives,"
they switch from one jurisdiction  to another.
"-It's, you know, like a...  -It's like a phone between cell masts?"
"Exactly. It tried to do that,  but there was nothing to switch to."
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then  they've used that to commandeer your ADI.
"No, you would need  a diagnostic controller to do that."
[Blue] What's the range on one of those?
"[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps."
So whoever was controlling it would have  to be no more than 20 metres away.
"-outside the house.  -Yeah. Sitting in a car, even."
-Can you trace back who did this?  -Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.
Uh...
You know what? Uh...  It would be easier without an audience.
Okay.
"You two swap numbers,  keep a line of communication."
Can you shut the whole thing down  if need be... hypothetically speaking?
"Even a short stoppage  would damage the ecosystem,"
and we'd need approval  from the Department of the Environment.
"We'll need a list of any Granular staff  that had access to that system,"
past or present.
[laughs] Some were government employees.
Use a different font for those  if it helps.
Bye.
[buzzing]
[buzzing]
"Nick, that's a set  of Granular personnel records."
Root out anyone interesting.
Maybe not just one.  Could be a group involved.
"Technically we should refer this up  to the NCA,"
but there's no fucking way  they're taking this off me.
The NCA already knows about it.
What?
DCI Karin Parke?
"-Yes.  -Shaun Li, National Crime Agency."
[Karin] How come you're here?
There's been more than one.
"This is Tusk, last night."
-Shit.  -they thought It was a fit.
Took him to the hospital.
He had to be anaesthetised  to stop him mutilating himself.
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind  of plaque or tumour in his brain
-so they popped him in the MRI.  -[groans]
Yeah. Basically one big magnet.
"Tore it right out of his head,  through the eye socket."
[groans]
Battered the ADI too.
Yours is more intact  so I'm gonna need it for analysis.
[Karin] It's evidence.
Two's a pattern. It knocks  any malfunction theory in the head.
-And they're similar victims.  -Similar?
Both in the middle of online shit storms.
"Well, if you wanna kill someone,  there's a million easier ways to do it."
Pull this off and you've done it  from across the street.
"No fingerprints, no DNA.  It's like wishing them dead."
Fuck.
Fuck.
Guys? Come here.
"Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk,"
"both were being kicked around  the Internet for hours,"
"but in both their cases,  people were also tweeting their photos"
accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.
-Like our friend the teacher.  -Right.
"She didn't know where she'd first heard  of it, but trace it back,"
and it looks like the first real use  of the hashtag was last weekend.
-By who?  -[Blue] Uh...
"Looks like, um..."
Looks like identical tweets  from a set of duplicate bot accounts.
Um...
Automated. It's like spam.
"This is someone trying to seed the tag,  you know? Get it out there."
It's like bait. This is someone  wanting people to pick up on it.
Check out the senders' avatar photos.
[Karin] Bees. Shit.
Okay.
There's more.
So each tweet had a sort of  instruction video attached to it.
-[Karin] Uh-huh.  -There.
"""Game of Consequences""?"
It's like an unpopularity contest.
"Pick someone you don't like and if enough  other people choose the same name,"
then that's who gets targeted.
"Here, watch."
[man] Game of Consequences.
"-One: Pick a target.  -[Karin] Oh, my God."
Two: Post their name and photo  with #DeathTo.
No.
Three: Most popular target  will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.
Four: Game resets at midnight.
"-[Nick] Oh, no.  -[Karin] Fuck."
"Someone's holding a public ballot,  bumping off the top person."
"-Jesus, it's just mad.  -Yeah, and it's growing."
"Day one. 63 people used the hashtag  on Jo Powers, okay?"
"On day two, 223 used it on Tusk."
-Who's using it now?  -There's-- There's loads more people.
There's quite a few votes  for the Chancellor.
-Yeah.  -Um...
But at number one...
is 880 people using it  on someone called Clara Meades.
-Who's she?  -Clara Meades.
"Okay, um...  it looks like she was at a demo,"
and she took a selfie  in front of a war memorial.
"-Pretending to piss On it.  -Nice work, Clara."
"Yeah, it's getting near the end  of the vote,"
and her mentions are blowing up.
"-Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?  -Um, no."
So people can't know the hashtag works.  They're using it to scare her.
"-Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.   -We need to get to her before five."
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.
You're not supposed  to have access to that.
"Yeah, I know. Just getting her location."
There.
[breathes heavily]
[computer chirrups repeatedly]
[phone ringing]
"[ringing stops, chirruping continues]"
[sighs]
[phone rings]
[woman] Hello?
[whimpers]
"[woman] Yeah, she is.   All right, all right, hold on."
Clara!
Police. For you.  How did they get my number?
-Hello?  -Clara Meades?
"This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police."
"Sorry to track you down like this,  but we think you may be in danger."
"Sorry, is this a joke? Because  all this stuff I'm getting is not funny."
I'm not joking.  Stay where you are until we get there.
And keep your windows closed.
I'm setting up a perimeter.
"Call Rasmus, we need him across this."
[sighs]
"-Rasmus?   -Hi, Blue."
I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.
I need you to monitor the area.
"Track my location and see if you get  anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?"
"Yeah, great, good."
"Look, if they come back,"
I think I can catch them.
I have basically set a trap.
"So if they--  if they try it again, we've got them."
-are you Batman?  -they only just rolled them out.
This'll turn every red light  between here and there to green.
"Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,  I should apply for a transfer."
Let's go.
We can take her here.
It's a safe house  for terrorist informers usually.
[helicopter whirring]
[sirens wailing]
[man over radio] No target sighted.
[man over loudspeaker]  This is a police operation!
Everybody vacate their premises now.
Please leave...
[gasps]
[computer pings]
-[Vanessa] What's that?  -[Rasmus] Someone's trying to break in.
-Rasmus?  -I just picked up an attempted breach.
"Granular, they've got a breach."
-[Rasmus] One ADI just went offline.  -Where?
-800 metres from your location.  -That's outside our cordon.
"If someone's trying to pilot it this way,"
they're gonna turn 'round  the moment they see all these uniforms.
Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke.  Did you pack a bag?
"-Yeah, it's by the door.  -Right, let's go."
-Rasmus got a track On them?  -Not yet.
[beeping]
"It's just precautionary,  and it's only for one night."
Just gotta call in.
Hi.
"No, not yet."
Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.
-Understood.  -[buzzing]
"They housed a witness here for a while,  Shaun said."
-Must've had kids.  -Have you got kids?
[both] No.
No plans.
[buzzing]
Up the stairs.
[phone rings]
-Rasmus.  -Still nothing. I can't trace it.
[sighs]
[sighs] At least there's an en-suite.
-Is there nothing?  -[Rasmus] No.
"Whoever it is,  they've masked their path well."
[beeping]
But that's not--
-Fuck.  -[Blue] What?
-We just lost a whole hive.  -What Does that mean?
Packed full of ADIs.
Lost them all too.
-No-- Rasmus?  -There's thousands of them.
-Where?  -It's close to your location. [static]
"Rasmus, say that again."
Blue? Blue. It's close...  It's very close to you.
Text it. Text it to me.  Rasmus. Text it to-- [static] Shit.
Do I get to redecorate?
[buzzing]
-[crackling on line]  -Hello. Hello.
[distorted voice]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] No...
They've got the whole thing.
We're not in control anymore.
-They've got the whole thing.  -[Vanessa] What are you doing?
-Fix it! Can't you fix it?  -Shut up!
[crackling on line]
[buzzing]
[buzzing continuing]
-[screams]  -[phone beeps]
[buzzing]
Shit.
[panting]
We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!
[buzzing]
"Go. Go, go, go."
[Shaun screams]
[loud buzzing]
[gasps]
[Clara] What's-- what's happening?
[buzzing]
-[rattling]  -[Blue] Karin...
-[rattling]  -[mutters]
[loud buzzing]
In there! Go!
[gasps]
-Help me block the gap!  -[Clara]Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring the shit out of me!
[loud buzzing]
[door rattles]
[gasps]
[buzzing and rattling continue]
-[rattling]   -[screams]
Oh! Fuck!
[buzzing]
-[buzzing]  -[screams]
[buzzing]
The fan! The fan! [screams]

[screams]
Get it away from me!

[screams hysterically]
[gasps]

[buzzing stops]
[panting]
[woman] Take your time.
I'd seen so many bodies before.
"At crime scenes, in autopsies."
But I'd never seen anyone die.
And she was right there.
"And can you describe the reaction  of your colleague, Miss Colson?"
Blue took it hard.
[Shaun] Uh-huh.
[man] I'll shut it down.
"We thought this was one guy,  some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity,"
hijacking one ADI  and personally controlling it.
[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.
"-So it can't be that, right?  -No."
-One person can't fly hundreds at once.  -No.
"Whoever this is,  they're controlling the whole system."
-do you know where from?  -could be anywhere.
You need to fucking sort this out!  [kicks table]
How do the ADIs know who to target?
"Could've found Clara the same way  you did, the identity database?"
No. That just gives you the basic area.
"We were in the room too,  and they only went for her."
Facial recognition.  It's got to be facial recognition.
"Which means the feed from their visual  sensors, that's been accessed too."
-[Shaun] That's not possible.  -[Blue] It's the only explanation.
"Now look, the visual feed is secure  between each ADI and the hive."
-there you go.  -Although...
one of the government's conditions  for backing the project...
Okay. Enough.
We had to consent to permitting  government security services
"access to the visual feed at times  of quote, ""increased national security."""
"Which is, as I understand it,  pretty much all the time."
-I wasn't happy about it.  -Your lot went along with it.
That implies a greater range  of options than your lot presented.
-So they are spying On us.  -This is all classified.
"So what did you do, did you put in  a back door and route it through GCHQ?"
"I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams."
So what don't you have  your fucking noses in?
"Look, millions of those things  flying around, propping up the ecosystem?"
"Well, that's great, save the planet,  hallelujah!"
Government's not going  to pump billions into it
"just 'cause some lab coat says so,  and it grabs 200 green votes."
"They saw an opportunity to get more,  they took it."
Total nationwide surveillance.
We tracked suspects for weeks  in ways they couldn't dream of.
"-We prevented bombings, mass shootings.  -By spying On the public."
"And keeping them safe,  which is what they want."
"Clara Meades isn't safe, though,  is she, Shaun?"
"Knowing what you knew,  that might've helped us,"
"but no,  you kept your little fucking secret."
Okay! The government's a cunt.  We knew that already.
Word's going to get out about Clara.
"The public's going to wake up and find  this mental assassination game going on,"
and soon we're going to have another body.
-So what do we do?  -I don't know.
We're totally locked out. Totally blind.
"If I can work out how they got in,"
I might be able to reverse engineer   some means of getting control back.
"Do the ADIs have a command log,  on-board cache?"
"-Yeah, but that's encrypted.  -I'll need the key to that."
[phone rings]
[sighs]
"Been through the employee files,  found some POIs."
Bring them in.
Are you sitting in on these?  Granular interviews?
I've got to be somewhere.
[radio beeping]
[woman on radio] It's 7:15.
Three deaths have now been linked  to a hashtag circulating on social media.
Controversial journalist Jo Powers...
[man on radio] Good morning.  Have you posted the hashtag?
Is it real or an urban myth?
"Well, thousands have been taking part,  but how culpable are they?"
"People are dying,  and we want to hear your thoughts."
"Line seven, Liana..."
"This is real, this is happening..."
I am happy to see her die.
[woman] It's not the hashtag killing them.  That's just a game.
"Like, if you're an arsehole,  you deserve to be shamed."
"[man on radio] Steve, line five."
"[man] Yeah, but my point is,  someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?"
"So why not make it someone,   you know, who deserves it, like a racist."
"[woman] With the hashtag, I've seen  celebrities, politicians, everyone."
This doesn't mean you have to sit there  encouraging people to take part.
The point is this is already happening.
And people know that they can jump onboard
because nobody will ever know  if they did or didn't.
"Well, let's just pause for a moment  and go back to that top five."
"As we have been saying,  the Chancellor is at number one,"
and I want us to think about that.
What does that tell us  about the choice of the nation?
"[woman] Well, I can't say I'm surprised  that he's number one on the list."
He's been pretty unpopular  for quite a long time now.
[interviewer] But does that warrant  his place on this list?
[woman] I'm saying people  don't have to think too hard about it.
"Now that's he's number one,"
that should generate more discussions  and probably more votes.
Thanks for your time.
-No good?  -No good.
"-Well, that's all fascinating...  -Shaun."
-But when do We shut It down?  -Tom.
Forgive me for being sceptical  about your agency's basic competence.
-Tom.  -I'm on the fucking chopping block here.
Number one on the list.  The people's fucking choice!
"Farrington's number four,  and he's a paedophile."
-Suspected paedophile.  -he Did it. you know he did.
"Let's just shut it down. All social media.  The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug."
"Just for today,"
at least until Thumbelina here  pulls his finger out
and he actually catches someone.
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.
-But it's possible? We can do that?  -The whole of social media?
"-Yeah. Pull a North Korea On it.  -Well, Yes, technically."
"-Right, so push the off switch.  -[Shaun] That's not a good idea."
-No?  -Not in My opinion.
"Right, okay. It's just that speaking   as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ."
"If we shut it down,  you'll still be number one."
"Guaranteed to be, in fact."
"He's right. If we let it run on,  at least there's a few hours."
Anything could happen before five o'clock.  The vote might change.
"Yeah, and it might not.  What about that report? The archive job?"
"From 1985, that memo about Farrington?"
-That was over an unrelated matter.  -[Tom] Leak it.
"Tom, that would be a smear."
"A head-to-toe shit smear,  I fucking hope so."
He's in his 80s. He's had his life.  Fuck him under the bus.
If I could suggest an alternative?  We move you to a safe location.
-Have you secured before five.  -Worked out Well for you last night.
I'll show you.
This next one's Tess Wallender.  She was a junior.
So not much  in the way of technical skills.
"-Quit Granular for personal reasons.  -Nervous exhaustion, Yeah."
Worked in Human Resources  for Granular until she quit.
"She took a photo of a guy on the Tube,  said he'd harassed her,"
lewd comments or something.
Turned out he had a learning disability  so she caught a ton of shit on--
On social media.
-Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.  -Hi.
It was like having a whole weather system  turn against me.
"Just hate message after hate message,  around the clock, all piling on."
It's hard to describe what that does  to your head.
"Suddenly  there's a million invisible people,"
all talking about how they despise you.
It's like a mental illness.
Fuck.
[Nick] What?
Shit.
"I mean, hands up, I made a mistake,"
"but the way people enjoyed kicking me,  that's what got to me."
"The casual fun they had and, um..."
I just felt I couldn't go on.
Who found you?
"Um... Garrett, my flatmate."
He found me in the bath  five minutes after I'd slashed them.
"I mean, it's crazy."
"I'm half-conscious.  He's dragging me out of the bath,"
"and I'm telling him to get out,  saying, ""I'm naked."""
"He tied towels 'round my wrists,  kept me conscious,"
"kept stroking my hair  till the ambulance arrived, talking to me."
Sort of weird.
I think he always had a thing for me.
"And we worked at the same place so,  you know... awkward."
-he Worked at Granular?   -Yeah. On the ADI thing.
-he was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.  -What Did you say his name was?
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.
Garrett Scholes.  We need the whereabouts of a Garrett--
Scholes. We were about to tell you.
It was buried in the on-board memory  of the Jo Powers' ADI.
-What was?  -A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.
And check this out.  There's fucking selfies in it.
[buzzing]
[man] So we're good to go?
[buzzing]
"Okay, that's the charge in place."
Okay. Pull back.
We're all set here.
Detonate.
[explosion]
"So, the plan is,  we move you to an underground bunker,"
knock out every hive  within a ten-mile radius.
"And, what, just leave me there?  How long for?"
It's a temporary measure.
How long till you take out all the hives?
"There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.  That would take two years."
"Two years, a victim a day."
"More to the point,  the environmental impact would--"
Fuck that.
[man] Shit!
-What?  -Fuck!
"Stay back, stay back!"
Get back!
[buzzing]
[men screaming]
"Go, go, go! Get away!"
[men screaming]
"For fuck's sake, move!"
"[static, buzzing]"
What's your Plan B?
[buzzing]
"He was on the original employee roster,  but we discounted him."
He left the country six months ago.
We thought we were looking  for someone nearby.
Run a full trace on him.  Everything we can find.
"Lunatic with production values,  that's the worst kind."
"""Thanks to the technological revolution,"
"we have the power to rage and accuse,  spout bile without consequence."
"Only by being forced to recognize  the power technology grants us,"
"to acknowledge  individual responsibility..."""
Is it all like this?
"He likens the population to insects,  says we revel in cruelty,"
that it's a weakness  that should be bred out of us.
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face  the consequences of what they say and do.
-Wants to force that on them.  -The whole thing's a moral lesson?
He wanted us to find this  and spread it about.
"Well, fuck him."
Fuck.
Shit.
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.
"He's put this document  together himself, right?"
His author name's in the metadata.
"But he stripped out everything else,"
"so we don't know when he's written it,  for example."
Mm-hmm.
"Most of the photos are clipart   off the Internet, except this one."
-The selfie.  -That's where he's screwed up.
"He's taken it with his phone,  and the phone left a geotag on the image."
-So you know where he took this?  -I know precisely where.
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

[Karin] Lifestyles of the rich and famous.
There. The forge.
[gasps]
[Karin] Nice one.
Half the drives I sifted in forensics  had scorch marks on 'em.
-[Blue] What do you think?  -Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.
-you can use it?  -Pretty much the key to the door.
So you can get control back?  Send the deactivation?
"[Rasmus] Well, I've got his source code."
-I should be able to bounce him out.  -be quick.
[Karin] Key to the door?
Our guy doesn't seem the type  to leave keys lying around.
"Well, I'm in."
Okay. Deactivate her.
"-Yeah, I need to repair permissions.  -fucking hell."
That's weird.
What's weird?
-[Shaun] Time's ticking.  -That file. Wasn't there before.
-This file?  -Yeah.
[computer beeps]
What is it?
-Blue?  -I think they're IMEI numbers.
What does that mean?
"Every phone, every device  has a unique number, an IMEI number."
It tethers it to a unique user.
"-Yeah.  -But I can check, just... reverse lookup."
[Rasmus] Take it easy.
[Karin] Who are these people?
"[Blue] I don't know.  There's 387,000 of them."
Are these IDs  your spooks have been collecting?
"-No!Are you ready yet?  -Yeah, almost there."
Wait. Wait.
What was the name of that teacher?  Hate cake.
-Liza. Liza Bahar.  -Liza Bahar.
[Shaun] Fuck's sake.
This is a list of everyone  who's used the hashtag.
What?
Everyone who took part  in the Game of Consequences.
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ  by the looks of it.
"That backdoor worked both ways, it seems."
-See if I'm on there.  -What?
I posted the tag earlier  with Scholes' face.
"-just trying to Get a reaction From him.  -Yeah, Yeah, almost there."
[Blue] You're there.
[Rasmus] Almost there.
Why has he collected everyone  who took part? I mean...
[Rasmus] Okay. I'm ready.
-Shit.  -Run It now.
No. Think. He left us a trail.
"-Oh, come on.  -That photo with the whereabouts,"
it's too big a mistake for him.  He knew we'd do this.
"-Now we're shutting it down, all right?  -And maybe that'll trigger some endgame,"
something to do with that list.
What if those are his real targets?
The people on the list.  Everyone who took part.
Consequences.
The hate figures were the bait.  The players are the target.
"-Run the deact command.  -[Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?"
-Run it.  -[Karin] No!
[beeping]
[gasps]
[beeping]
[Rasmus] Yeah. [laughs]
"Yeah, it worked."
[Shaun sighs]
"Sorry, but that needed doing. [laughs]"
[beeping]
"-No, no, no, no, no.  -[Karin] What?"
No. No.
-[Rasmus] Fuck!  -[Karin] No.
[Karin] Shit.
"Oh, no."

[woman] We're all tragically familiar with  the rest of the events of that week.
And we need no reminding  of the sheer scale
of the loss of life that followed.
"No. No, we don't."
[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?
I think she blamed herself.
No. I know she did.
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb  trail and sprung the whole thing.
She left the force.
I didn't hear from her.
"Rang her, tried emailing, but no response."
"Then, um..."
"About four months later,  they found her things."
On a beach.
With a note.
[breathes deeply]
She killed herself?
"That's the base theory, yes."
"Ms Parke, I would like to commend you"
for sharing your testimony and your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.

-[man] Captain Daly.  -Report.
A non-federation vessel jumped straight  out of white space right in front of us.
-Valdack.  -That can't be.
"My data scan indicates  a heavily armored Gorgan Dreadnought,"
vessel ID number 9864321.
"Thank you, Dudani. Valdack must have  hijacked it from the Fermi hub"
and tracked our position.
"-Tulaska, shield status?  -Shields 100%."
-Helmsman Packer?  -Captain.
-Prime rear thrusters.  -rear thrusters primed.
"[Walton]  If that's Valdack, he'll rip us to shreds."
"Captain, we have to surrender.  There's no other way."
"Let's not lose our heads,  Lieutenant Walton."
[zapping]
-Shields at 68%.  -[alarm wailing]
"Heavy damage reported,  decks six through ten."
Fires in med center  and major rupture to cargo bay Alpha.
We've got no choice!
"Do you want me to open comms  with Valdack's craft, Captain?"
-Negative.  -[zapping]
[all groan]
-Shields at 54%.  -There's no way out.
"-Captain, please.   -[Daly] Not now, Walton."
"Helmsman Packer,  take us into that asteroid gas cluster."
"-Into the cluster?  -That's suicide, sir."
It is our only chance.
[Daly] That gas cluster is charged  with ionized pyron particles.
"If our shields hold, we can use them  to increase our photon intensity."
"Packer, increase thrusters."
[engine thrusts]
[Tulaska] Shields at 43%.
"It'll tear the ship apart, Captain!"
"Walton, you are a Space Fleet officer.  Act accordingly."
-Shields at 32%.  -Valdack's not following.
"Packer, turn us around."
[engine rumbles]
"-[Daly] Tulaska, charge photon bolts.  -Bolts charged, Captain."
-Fire!  -[zapping]
"His hull's breached, shields gone.  He's defenseless."
"-Lieutenant Lowry, open comms.  -He's already hailing us, Captain."
-[Daly] On screen.  -[bleeps]
"Captain Daly, may you drown  in the venom of 900 Tragorian snakes!"
"[Daly] You are defeated, Valdack."
Return the plasmorthian crystal  and we'll cause you no more damage.
"You must think me a fool, Captain!"
"I know the crystal's capabilities,  and I will die before I give it up!"
"I gave you a chance, Valdack,  showed you mercy."
-Reflect on that while you can.  -[yells]
-Close comms.  -[bleeps]
"-Tulaska, destroy his ship.  -Yes, Captain."
[bleeping]
[zaps]
"-That was incredible, Captain.  -you saved our lives."
"[Walton] I'm so sorry  I lost it back there, Captain."
"Not for the first time, Walton."
And I should know by now  never to doubt you.
-[alarm beeps]  -[Walton] Please forgive me.
"At ease, Walton."
"Captain, sensors indicate  an escape pod ejected"
from Valdack's ship before detonation.
He's escaping with the crystal.
"You want me to plot  a pursuit course, Captain?"
No.
We'll let him go... for now.
"-Great decision-making, Captain.  -Three cheers for Captain Daly."
-Hip hip.  -[all] Hooray!
-Hip hip.  -[all] Hooray!
-Hip hip.  -[all] Hooray!
For he's a jolly good fellow  For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us

Hey.

"Uh... Elena, my pass doesn't work."
You must renew on first of each month.
"Yeah, I know that,  but the first was on the weekend, so..."
OK.
-[beeps]  -[doors open]
Thank you.
You're welcome.
[automated voice] Prepare to enter
"the most immersive gaming experience  in years,"
"Infinity, from Callister Inc."
"-Morning, Mr. Daly.  -Helmsman Packer."
Huh?
"Uh, I mean, Mr. Packer. Nate."
[laughs]
OK.
[Daly] Are you making coffees?
Yeah.
Do you think maybe  you could make me one too?
"[laughs] Sure, sure. Uh, what do you want?"
Just vanilla latte. Skim milk.
"Yeah, good call. 'Cause..."
[Packer clears throat]
[chattering]
"[woman]  ...those are very, very big numbers."
"We might just have to hold you to that.  Well, no, yes, of course. [laughs]"
Sure. Yes.
[crashing]
"Oh, are you OK, man?"
[sighs]
I guess you didn't see my gym bag.
Here. Come on. [strains]
"-I'm sorry, bud. [pats]  -OK."
You left it... [groans]
[man] You're gonna do it for me  and make it good.
You know you are a god to me at least.
[laughing]
[knock on door]
Oh. The ladies' bathroom is that way.  The sign's kind of confusing.
"You're Robert Daly, right?"
"-Right.  -Yeah, hi."
"I'm Nanette, Nanette Cole."
Um...
"I started here today,  coding on the update,"
"and I just wanted to, uh,  pass on my admiration"
to the person  who actually designed Infinity.
The procedural algorithm is amazing.
It's just some beautiful code.
Thank you.
That's actually the reason  that I wanted to work here.
"-You must be busy. I'm so sorry.  -No, no, it's fine."
-Sorry. [laughs]  -No.
"-Well, just fangirling. Sorry. Um...  -[both laugh]"
[Nanette gasps]
Ooh... vintage.
"-Yeah, it's Space Fleet.  -Wow."
[Daly] It's a TV show. Before your time.
"Before my time, actually."
But it was... visionary.
"Is this on, like, tape?"
"Yeah, I've got the VHS, the DVD, Blu-ray."
The whole thing. Seasons one to six.
"Netflix has it these days, but..."
Aboard the spaceship USS Callister.
"-OK, yeah.  -Mm-hmm."
"So-- OK, so Callister is like the, uh--"
"Yeah, when we set up the company, um..."
I suggested we call it Callister  as kind of a little tribute.
"Walton didn't really get the reference,  but he let me have that one."
Mini-skirted damsels.
[laughs]
A little cold for that in space.
That is just what a Bargradian  sand warrior would say.
[Nanette chuckles]
"[Walton] Bob, Christmas is closing in  like a goddamn meteor."
We've got customers all over our balls  waiting for the Infinity update.
Tell me it's gonna be up and running  before the weekend.
"-Oh, I'll ask Kabir--  -You're CTO. Don't ask anybody anything."
You should be telling people things  like I'm telling you right now.
-I'll talk to him.  -Good.
-I'm sorry.  -OK.
-Hello.  -[Nanette] Hello.
"Sorry, I couldn't find a good moment to..."
"Oh, you must be new.  Uh... I'm James Walton. I run the company."
"-[Nanette] I--  -Well, we run the company, kind of."
"Bob here is the hardware,  and I am the shiny front end."
-I'm Nanette Cole.  -[Walton] Which department?
-Engine architecture.  -And it's your first day?
Uh...
-[stutters] Yeah.  -Have you had the tour?
"-[keyboard clicking]  -No, I..."
"Please, allow me."
[Nanette] OK.
It was so nice to meet you. [laughs]
[Walton] Just a little bit.
It's a different environment  I set up here.
"People call it a carefree environment.  I call it ""care-full."""
-[Nanette] Interesting.  -Not scary.
[chattering continuing]
Dudani?
Kabir?
Mm. Mr. Daly.
Do you have the latest ETA  on the update patch?
It's just there's still  some runtime errors.
"Well, the thing is, we could have it ready  by end of play today,"
"but if we had time,  we could alter the trading mechanics,"
"tweak the critical hit system,  but of course, that'd add another week,"
maybe ten days or so.
Mr. Daly?
"-Yeah. Yeah, do all of that, thank you.  -I'll... OK, we're on it."
"[chattering, laughing]"
[number pad bleeps]

[device boots up]
"[Walton] Welcome back, Captain."
Have you located Valdack's position?
"Not yet, but our sensors  are scanning every star system"
between here and Valatros.
So your answer is no?
Uh...
"I'm afraid so, sir."
"[Walton gasps, groans]"
[grunting]
"You... are pathetic, Walton. What are you?"
-[Walton gasping]  -What's that?
[inhales] Pathetic.
[gasps]
"[groans, panting]"
[Daly] So Valdack's out there somewhere
and you village idiots  are asleep at the wheel.
"You're not just disgraceful,  you're disgusting, all of you."
So can you do one thing?
Can you find Valdack?
I'm not asking. I'm telling you!  Understand?
-Hmm?  -Yes.
"-[Daly] Yes?  -Yes, Captain. Yeah."
"-[Daly] Yes.  -Aye, Captain."
[Daly] Huh?
"Well, all right."
"Tulaska, check security protocols.  If they've expired, you're in trouble."
"-Yes, Captain.  -[bleeping]"
"Dudani, recheck those probe results."
"-No room for errors.  -of course, Captain."
-Helmsman Packer?  -Captain.
Vanilla latte.
-Skim milk.  -at once.
[Daly] Walton.
Exit game.
[device whirs]

"Hi, Nanette. You feel like  you have everything you need here?"
Mm-hmm.
-All right. That's a nice sweater.  -Oh. Thank you.
-[Walton] Cashmere?  -[chattering]
[knock on door]
"Mr. Daly, got that new ETA  on the update patch."
"-New ETA?  -Yeah, it's all good."
But now we're looking  at December 24th for rollout.
We don't patch until Christmas Eve?
"Well, yeah, I mean,  with the alterations you approved."
"OK, OK. Thank you."
[Dudani] OK.
[door closes]
[knock on door]
"-Hi, Robert.  -hi."
"Um, I was just gonna fix a coffee.  Do you want one?"
-Sure.  -OK.
Um... vanilla latte with skim milk.
-[Nanette] Okey-dokes.  -OK.
Absolutely.
[laughs]
Mm-hmm.
"-Well, yes, they are great numbers.  -[machine whirs]"
[laughs] OK. Mm-hmm.
-Ta-ta.  -[device beeps]
Total fucking shitwit.
"-do you want coffee?  -Um, Brushed Suede. thank you."
So how are you settling in?  Are you settling in?
"Uh, yeah, yeah.  Everyone here is really friendly."
"And um...  it is not like my last job, thank God."
"-Yeah?  -it was a toxic workplace, you know."
-My boss was a major-league bully and...  -[machine beeps]
"-It's not like here, like with Mr...  -Walton."
"-Yeah.   -Oh, yeah. He's a really good guy."
He's a bit of a player.
"Chuck a sandwich across the room,  he'll fuck it before it hits the ground,"
-but he's basically an all right bloke.  -[chuckles]
"OK. [laughs] Well, there's uh...  two bosses here anyway, so I guess--"
-Two how?  -Robert Daly.
Oh!
"I mean, well, yeah, technically. [scoffs]"
Mr. Daly is actually  the whole reason that I'm here.
-Really? Interesting.  -[Nanette] I mean...
"Who wouldn't wanna work under  an incredible mind like that, you know?"
His coding is... [laughs] It's sublime.
Do you have a thing for him?
"Daly? No, no. No. It's not like that."
[stammers] It's purely...  It's professional.
I like his code.
"Ah. Fucking hell,  I was gonna say, you know,"
don't be too nice to him  'cause he gets a bit starey.
Mm.
"Wide berth, that's my advice. Wide berth."
-OK.  -yeah.
Thank you.
-There you go.  -thank you.
[exhales]
-[Lowry] Bye.  -No bye. I'm coming.
"[Lowry] No. Suck a dick, Karl."

"Oh, boy. It looks like  there's a new girl in the office."
"What's your name, hon?"
[Walton] Come in. Let me fix you a drink.
We have everything  from Bengarian phlegm shots to uh...
"ooh, distilled root blood  from the Cangor quadrant."
"What's your poison? Some of this  actually is poison, so don't be shy."
Am I dreaming?
"Yeah, no, no, 'fraid not."
-I remember dreaming.  -[Packer] Me too.
[Nanette] But where am I?
"This is the USS Callister,  Space Fleet's finest,"
exploring the furthest reaches   of the known universe and beyond.
"We are its loyal space crew  and now, apparently, so are you. Cheers."
[slurps]
"Your name? Babe, what's your name?"
Nanette. We've met.
"Maybe, in the real world.  I wouldn't have no way of knowing."
-What do you mean?  -You'd better sit down.
"No, I don't... I don't wanna sit down."
I wanna know what's going on.
You're on board Robert Daly's ship.
"Robert Daly, the CTO?"
"Here he's Captain Daly,  our fearless leader."
"[Lowry] Yeah, you're seriously  gonna need to sit the fuck down."
-Uh...  -Welcome. [chuckles]
"You are um... Hey, hey.  You're the intern from work, right? Nate?"
Packer. Nate Packer.
Wait. So I'm still  just the intern out there?
Jesus.
You're um... You're... You're...
Dudani. Diagnostics.
-Welcome.  -Right.
"-You're the receptionist, right?  -Elena."
"-Your skin is blue.  -[Tulaska] Weird blue alien skin, I know."
It's fucked up.
Almost sort of racist.
[groans]
"[strains] OK. Walt, fix her something,  something she'll recognize. Vodka."
-Hey. So what's it like out there now?  -What?
-What year is it?  -[Lowry] Don't do her head in.
-[Packer] What?  -What year? I... [stutters] saw you today.
Ooh. Did you see me? Did I look thin? Hmm?
"Like, wheatgrass yogurt thin?"
Can we not pop her fucking mind?
Someone needs  to be straight with me right now.
"OK. OK, listen."
This is Infinity.
That's what we're all inside.  That's where all of this exists.
"Infinity, the game?"
"Daly's got his own modded version  of Infinity,"
reskinned to look like  his favorite TV show.
-Space Thing? Space Thing?  -Space Fleet.
-Hence the groovy decor.  -And this tasteful get-up.
Infinity.
"That's an online game,  like a multiplayer deal. This... [inhales]"
"This is his development build,  sealed off so he can control it."
He keeps it offline
so the custom code he's written  can't be detected and deleted.
"Mm. Yes, it's a bubble universe,  ruled by an asshole god."
He...
put us in... in here?
Mm-hmm.
Drink your vodka.
"-How do we get out?  -No, really, drink it."
Drink it.
-You can't leave.  -[chokes] What?
None of us can.
-Because you're not actually you.  -[Nanette] What?
"I know it's mental,  but you're a copy of you."
-a digital clone.  -No.
"No, I am... I'm me. I am me."
"-I'm me.  -[Walton] No, not the real you."
"Daly's created an identical  digital version of you, of all of us."
From your DNA.  He'll have harvested it somehow.
He told me he got mine  from the rim of a smoothie cup.
He retrieved Packer's juices  from the bathroom.
"Man, you have got to let that go.  She does not need details."
Basically he's got a gizmo--
I theorize an advanced  biometric DNA virtual clone.
He's got a fucking gizmo.  That's what I said.
"He fed your DNA in,  he put you inside his computer"
"and, bam, you pop up here like a Pop-Tart."
"Yeah, we've all been through it."
"He brings us in for different reasons,  shit we did in the office."
I called him out for staring.
I reset admin permissions  on a test build for 14 minutes.
Insufficient smiling.
"-I brought him the wrong sandwich.  -OK, never mind the reasons."
"The point is that we're stuck  in Daly's playground,"
and that's all you need to know.
"This is a dream. Yeah, it has to be."
It's more like an eternal waking nightmare  from which there is no escape.
"-No, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.  -[Lowry] Oh, for fuck's sake,"
I'm trying to break her in gently.
"The quicker she gets it,   the easier it'll be."
[whirring]
[Tulaska] Daddy's home.
[Packer] He'll be here any moment.
[Nanette] No. I'm gonna get out of here.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!  You gotta stay on the bridge."
He controls everything.
-He does shit to make us cooperate.  -get off.
-You have no idea. I'm trying to help.  -[Lowry] Just leave it.
He's gonna fuck us up  if she doesn't play ball.
"Yes, well, she's gonna have to work it out  for herself, like we all did."
[panting]
[spaceship whirring]
[groans]
-There's gotta be a way out. Come on.  -[beeps]
[whimpers]
[screaming]
[whimpers]
"Lieutenant Cole, welcome aboard."
"Crew, we have a new member of the team,  Science Officer Nanette Cole."
"Please, take your post."
I believe we've finally managed  to track Valdack to an uncharted planet.
-No.  -Take Your post. That is an order.
I'm not doing this.
The whole thing's much better  if you let yourself get into it.
If you think that I'm playing along  with your Space Force bullshit...
-Space Fleet.  -[Nanette] Whatever.
-you can think again.  -this is My ship.
-I am Your Captain. an order is an order.  -Then go fuck yourself.
Sir.
OK. So we're doing it this way.
[scoffs]
[mocking] Are you gonna throw a fireball?
[snaps fingers]
[muffled gasps]
[thuds]
[muffled sounds]
"Oh, dear. You can't see.  You can't breathe."
"Unpleasant, isn't it?"
[muffled groaning]
Do you submit?
"You won't die, you know."
No one dies in here unless I want them to.
I can keep you like this forever  if I feel like it.
Forever gasping for breath  with a mouth that isn't there.
Do you submit?
[muffled agreement]
Good girl.
"[gasps, coughing]"
[breathes heavily]
"Lieutenant Cole, Valdack's hideout.  Triangulate the signal, please."
[Nanette pants]
[sobs]
[whispers]  It's any button. They're all the same.
[beeps]
[beeps]
Well?
[gasping] I'm getting a signal  from a class five planet.
-Rannotch.  -[Lowry] Rannoch.
"[stutters, whispers] Rannoch B."
"Excellent. Dudani,  prepare the transmat system."
"-of course, Captain.  -Walton, Packer, Lowry, with me."
"We'll transport down to the planet,  reclaim the crystal"
and bring Valdack to justice.
"Actually, Cole, you come too."
Perfect opportunity for you to prove
you're more than a recommendation  from Space Fleet. What do you say?
"-Mr. Dudani, transport.  -Aye Aye, Captain."
[all exhale]
"[Nanette gasps, groans]"
[Daly] Breathable atmosphere.
[device whirs]
Scanning for plasmorthian traces.
Crystal's this way. Let's go.
"-Nate. Hey, Nate.  -Helmsman Packer, OK?"
Call me Helmsman Packer. He hates it  when we don't use our proper titles.
"OK. You got a gun, so let's take him out."
"-Then give it to me.  -OK, one, our guns don't even work."
"Only his does. And two, the motherfucker  is invincible, OK? Come on, let's go."
At least you've got a gun.
[device whirring]
-Captain.  -[Daly] Shh.
"We meet again, Captain Daly!"
[cackles]
-We're trapped.  -[gun whirs]
Not advisable.
My plasma grenade  will turn you into screaming soup.
"He's not going to kill us, Captain."
He had the element of surprise.  He'd have done it when he had the chance.
"Haven't worked out how to use the crystal,  have you, Valdack?"
"It's true, I require  your Space Fleet knowledge."
But it's also true  that you're gonna give it to me!
Don't be so sure.
[laughs]
-Jesus. I...  -Shh.
Let's see how your resolve holds up
once you're devoured one by one  by my Arachnajax!
[roars]
"-Holy shit. Oh, my God.   -[Walton] We're all gonna die."
"[Arachnajax snarls, snorts]"
[roars]
"Killing us won't make us tell you  how the crystal works, Valdack."
-We will never...  -[device rings]
Hold on. I think my pizza's here.
-[sighs]  -[device rings]
Pause game.
[powering down]
[Nanette] What's happening?
[Walton] You heard him.  He paused the game.
'Cause he's got a pizza delivery...  out there.
[Arachnajax pants]
[doorbell ringing]
Hold on.
[doorbell continues]
[Arachnajax exhales]
[Packer] Watch out. He'll be back soon.
Ah. That's good.  This launcher's heavy as shit.
[Valdack] How you holding up?
"You know, we're existing."
"How you doing, Gillian?"
[Arachnajax grunts]
"Well, yeah."
"-[Walton] Well, you look great.  -Her name's Gillian."
-[Walton] Did you lose weight?   -She was in marketing.
"Yeah, Daly turned her into... that"
because she wouldn't play along  when he cloned her into here.
"[Lowry] This universe is littered  with things like her,"
poor fuckers who stepped out of line.
-Thank you.  -[man] Thanks.
[device whirs]
-[Walton] Here comes Captain Dick.  -Hey.
-[Packer] Hey. Hey.  -[Arachnajax growls]
[reciting] I'm gonna get you.  I'm gonna get you.
Hey. Hey.
[Walton exhales]
"If we die, the secret of the crystal dies  with us, Valdack."
"Oh, my God. We are all gonna die!"
-[fake sobbing]  -[Valdack laughs]
"-[Daly] Valdack?  -What is it, Captain? Final words?"
Over there. A naked lady.
Really?
-[gun blasts]  -[Valdack groans]
"[screams, grunts]"
[Arachnajax whimpers]
"Great plan, Captain."
[all laugh]
"[Walton] Unparalleled tactics, Captain."
[panting]
"We've fought many battles,  haven't we, Captain?"
We have.
"And I've been a good adversary for you,  have I not?"
[sighs]
Then please...
[coughs]
...end it.
-Please.  -[gun whirs]
Killing in cold blood  is against Space Fleet code.
-[groans]  -I wish I could help.
[mutters]
"Sorry, bud."
[whimpers]
-[Daly] Take him to the brig.  -[Valdack groans]
-[Daly] Dudani.  -Captain.
"-Transport us aboard.  -Yes, Captain."
[Valdack] No more.
"-[Lowry] It's OK.  -[Valdack wails, echoing]"
-[Walton] Hip hip.  -[all] Hooray!
-Hip hip.  -[all] Hooray!
[clapping]
[all]  For he's a jolly good fellow  For he's a jolly fellow
- For he's a jolly good fellow   -[Nanette grunts]
"And so say...  Oh, my fuck."
That wasn't very nice.
Today I will show you mercy.
"-Great mercy-showing, Captain.  -Shh!"
Tomorrow you should reconsider  your... amenability.
I may not be feeling so benevolent.
Exit game.
-Oh. Fucking hell.  -this was tense.
I don't like tense.
-Drink?  -Mm-hmm.
[Dudani] So how was the mission?
Wasn't too bad. Usual standoff storyline.
-Ooh. Saw Gillian from marketing. yeah.  -Oh.
There is no way  that I am kissing that asshole.
Then he's just gonna get  more and more pissed.
"-How about you kiss him, then?  -[Lowry] You get used to it."
It's-- There's no tongues.
"If that's any consolation,  there's never any tongues."
-Doing tongues is not Space Fleet way.  -Mm.
It's not like it can go  beyond kissing anyway.
What do you mean?
Oh. You haven't noticed?
[Walton clears throat]
[Nanette] What are you doing?  [stammers]
"Please. Please, don't do that. Don't..."
"Oh, my God."
-Oh. Oh. Oh.  -[Walton] Yes.
There's no genitals in Space Fleet.  This is a wholesome universe.
[Dudani] He must have modified  our code that way.
"Mm. We're all the same. If you don't  believe me, take a look down there."
We have tried grinding our mounds  together out of sheer boredom.
-No sensation at all.  -Can't even shit.
Can't even have the basic fucking pleasure  of pushing out a shit.
[sighs] I miss taking shit.
OK.
Stealing my pussy is a red fucking line.
-We are gonna get this bastard!  -[Walton] No.
-[Nanette] Yeah.  -We've tried a million times.
No way out.
"Walton. Come on, Walton."
"[Walton] Like I said, he's an asshole god."
Mnh-mnh.
"Daly's smart, but he's not a god."
He's a coder.
He is fallible.
"Kabir, what was that thing he was holding  in his hand, that scanner thing?"
"His omnicorder,  primary communications device."
You said he kept his version  of the game offline.
"But the omnicorder made contact with   the outside world when the pizza came,"
so it's gotta be connected  to his home system at least.
The omnicorder's gone.
"It loads when he loads, and it goes  when he goes, and that's the only one."
No.
There has got to be a way to connect.
[beeping]
You won't hack it. I've tried.
I haven't.
[beeping continues]
[Nanette gasps] Bingo.
"-[Dudani] Oh, that's good.  -Yeah."
-This is part of Infinity's front end.  -Yeah.
You can invite a friend  with a custom message.
-[Lowry] A message to outside?  -Just one. 140 characters maximum.
So who are you gonna contact?
-[exhales]  -[elevator dings]
Thirteenth floor. Welcome to Callister.
"-Hey, Elena.  -[sighs] Hi."
[phone vibrates]
"-You need me buzz you in?  -What? Uh, no, no, I--"
-I got That for you.  -Oh. thank you.
After you.
[card beeps]
Um...
"Mr. Daly, hi."
Hi.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Did you just send me an Infinity invite?
Wha... No.
It was really weird.  It had a message attached.
Something about people trapped  in a game.
Probably just a spambot.  Firewall doesn't always get them all.
-Yeah.  -I wouldn't-- I wouldn't worry about it.
"You didn't open the link, did you?"
"Oh, God, no."
-Maybe upgrade Your security software.  -all Right.
Have a good one.
[chattering]
[guitar strumming]
That's the thing there.
"[Walton sighs] Oh, yeah."
"Could you please, please  cut that shit out?"
I'm trying to make it like a hobby.  [grunts]
"[grunts] Oh, that's good."
[electronic buzzing]
That is way too early.  He's only been at work a few hours.
[buzzing]
She got the message!
[stuttering] I did. It's me.
That's me or the cops most likely.
Oh. We are getting out of here!
[door slides shut]
[Daly] What is Space Fleet?
I'll tell you what it is.
It is a belief system...
founded on the very best of human nature.
It is a goal for us to strive towards
"for the betterment of the universe,"
for the betterment of life itself.
And you assholes are fucking it up!
I did it. I did. I did it.
I sent the message. It was me.
"No one else was involved, I swear."
I tried the carrot. Now meet the stick.
"No, this is gonna make you happy,  Daly, 'cause you're sick."
And you need help.
"[Lowry] No, don't, don't!"
Captain.
"Captain, please."
"[Lowry]  OK, look, she's new. She'll behave."
We'll all behave.
Just let her off. Let her off this once.
[stuttering] Please.
OK.
[gasps]
OK.
OK.
"-[Nanette] No! Daly, no! No, no, no, no!  -[cracking]"
"-[screams, inhuman grunts]  -[cracking]"
[roars]
[cracking]
[roars]
-[growls]  -[Nanette whimpers]
[gasping]
[Daly] You know what makes me happy?
The look on your face right now.
[whimpers]
"[Daly] Dudani, Walton, Tulaska,  take this thing to the brig with Valdack."
"Packer, find a barren planet  we can dump her on."
And you... can just stay here  and think about your attitude.
-[sobs]  -[Daly] Exit game.
[Nanette gasping]
[distant rumbling]
[breathes heavily]
[bleeps]
Update patch.
[exhales]
The update patch.
"[Nanette] It's there, there."
-So what? It's a wormhole.  -[Nanette] Unh-unh.
That is the Christmas update patch  preinstalling itself.
The wormhole... it's just how  the game is expressing the uplink.
So?
Daly's custom build  is still connected to the internet.
Some way.
"If this is another one of your plans,"
just stop before somebody else  gets monsterfied.
"No, no, this... this can work."
We can't get all-in access from the ship.  He'll have crippled permissions.
"Yes, but what if we fly into the wormhole?"
"-[scoffs] Like, on purpose?  -We'd hit the system firewall."
-Exactly. yeah.  -And have our rogue coding deleted.
-Deleted as in...?  -as in die.
Whether it's dying would depend  on your position regarding sentient code--
"We would cease to exist, that's true.  But we'd be free."
We'd be... free.
This is academic since we have no means  of getting to the wormhole.
There's no way to pilot the damn thing  without Daly here
and he can stop us like that.  [snaps fingers]
What about if he's logged in  but on pause?
"Like when his pizza came,  he was just frozen there."
"Flying would be possible,  but that wormhole's a whole parsec away."
We'd never reach it before he got back.
[Nanette]  Unless we stalled him for longer.
[Tulaska] And that we do how?
"If we can get Daly's omnicorder,  we can make a phone call, right?"
"Theoretically, yes, but--"
"If we can get real me on the phone again,  I, um... I may have some leverage."
-Leverage? on yourself?  -Mm-hmm.
-Like What?  -My PhotoCloud account.
"I know the password, obviously."
There are some pretty...
"interesting images on there that I should  have deleted a while ago, but I didn't."
"So, we can blackmail me."
I'm pretty sure that I'd do anything  to keep those photos from getting out.
Must be pretty pictures.
"Look, if this is going to work,  we all have to be in on it."
OK?
[Walton and Packer sigh]
Flying into certain death in a wormhole
"beats another 10,000 years  with Captain Ass."
-I'm in.  -OK.
Me too.
-Also me.  -[Nanette exhales]
"Well, I am out."
[Walton sighs]  Daly won. Daly's always won.
We just have to get on with it...  'cause we don't have a chance.
"-[Nanette] Yes, we do.  -Hmm?"
We fly into the wormhole  and we are extinct.
We are gone. We are rid of his shit.
Sounds peachy.
What is with you?
Don't you wanna fight back?  Why won't you fight back?
Tommy.
-Who is Tommy?  -[Walton] He's my son.
"He's six years old,  at least he was when I woke up in here."
"See, in the early days of this ship,  it was just me and Daly."
I was his pet project.
"He tried everything to break me,"
and I withstood it all  'cause I just thought
there was still a chance I could get out  and see my boy again.
"In a way, I was right,  I did get to see him again."
Just not the real him.
Daly told me what happened.
"Back on the outside, the real me, uh...  brought Tommy to work one day,"
showed him around.
He would've loved  seeing all those computers.
He's really into that stuff.
"Anyway, evidently...  Tommy had a lollipop that day."
That's all Daly needed.
He copied him in here.
It was Tommy all right.
He was alike in every way.
Dad!
[Tommy] Daddy...
You know what he did to him?
[Walton] Tommy!
He took Tommy  and he threw him out of the airlock.
-[Walton] Tommy!  -Daddy!
[capsule depressurizes]
-Right out into space.  -Daddy! No!
And he made me watch.
[capsule releases]
Tommy!
Have you ever seen an unsuited body  compress in space?
They freeze...
and crack like a porcelain doll.
I take my hat off to Daly. [sniffles]
The detail in this place is exceptional.
"And he said he'd do it again and again,"
'cause Daly's still got Tommy's DNA.
He's got all of our DNA.
He keeps it in his bedroom  in a fucking mini fridge by his desk.
"So I have to stay in line,"
"because even if we die in here,  he can bring us back."
He can bring Tommy back  whenever he wants.
And God knows how  he'd take it out on him.
God knows what he'd do.
"So, you see, what choice do I have?"
Walton.
We are gonna get that fucking lollipop.
[Walton sighs]
But you gotta believe me.
Can you do that?
Can you?
[bleeps]
[door slams]
[slurping]
[mouse clicks]
[triumphant music]
"Good to see you at your position, Cole."
"Captain, you've come  at just the right time."
I have?
I'm picking up a distress signal  from the surface of Skillane IV.
Looks like a crashed shuttle.
What should we do?
Space Fleet never turns its back  on those who need our help.
"-Dudani, set a course for Skillane IV.  -Aye Aye, sir."
"We'll send a search party.  Packer, Tulaska--"
"Actually, Captain, I was thinking  maybe you could take me alone."
"As science officer,  I need to learn the ropes,"
and I could use your close attention.
Good.
"Yes, good idea."
[Nanette exhales]
[omnicorder whirs]
[Daly] Atmosphere's good.
[omnicorder clicking]
[Daly] Over there.
"[Daly] From here,  the shuttle appears to be deserted."
"We'll scout the area,  check for any life forms. Daly out."
"Cole, we should head out this way. Cole..."
"[Nanette]  It's kind of hot here, don't you think?"
"Oh, my God."
"[Daly] What are you doing, Cole?"
"[Nanette]  The water looks so inviting, doesn't it?"
[Daly] What are you talking about?
"[Nanette] Come on, Robert."
-Ooh!  -[splashes]
"Oh, the water is great. [laughs]"
Swimming is a leisure activity.
We're on Space Fleet duty.
You know what?
We could always say  that I started drowning
and you had to come in and rescue me.
Yeah?
"Oh, what about that? [laughs]"
Come on. Come on in.
[laughs] I... Cole.
-[laughs] Come on.  -Cole.
Come on.
"Come on in, my big captain."
OK.
[Nanette] Come on.
Are you gonna take all day?
[Daly] OK.
"-OK, I'm coming in.  -[Nanette giggles]"
[beeps]
"OK, gotta patch it in."
[keyboard beeps]
[Dudani] It worked. I'm connected.
-gonna access her PhotoCloud account.  -you remember That password?
"Uppercase Y998, lowercase gb7,  uppercase TY ampersand 4."
Secure choice.
[sighs] There are thousands of images.  This could take a while.
Boring life.
[scrolling]
[scrolling]
Goddamn.
That is... gymnastic physique.
It's nice... nice bedding.
[scrolling]
"Oh. OK, should I keep scrolling?"
Any of the last nine would do.
Ow!
-[laughs] Thank you.  -Pleasure.
"-Um, are you heading out for the night?  -Yes."
Because it's Christmas Eve and we've got  ten days off work to recover from it.
Go home.
"-I will. I just have to finish--  -Yeah, whatever. Merry Christmas, loser."
"[laughs] Yeah. OK, Merry Christmas."
[clears throat]
[phone vibrates]
[gasps]
"Oh, my God."
"Elliott, you fucking asshole."
[phone vibrates]
[beeps]
"[robotic voice] Nanette Cole,  we've hacked your PhotoCloud account"
and have control of the entire contents  of your photo gallery.
Who is this? Um...
[stutters] What do you want?
What we want is for you to do  exactly as instructed
or your entire gallery
will be shared  with your friends and your family.
And PornHub.
"[Nanette] OK, yeah."
"[stuttering]   I'll do what you want, anything."
I'll do anything.
Then listen carefully.  We don't have much time.
"Stand up, get your coat  and follow our instructions."
[Nanette] OK.
[giggling]
-[Daly] Where are we going?  -We're just swimming.
"It's nice, right?"
-[Daly] Yes.  -Yeah. [laughs]
We should probably head back.
"Help! [screams]  Something grabbed me, I think."
"No, it didn't. I don't think anything did.  I'm sorry."
I think I imagined it. [laughs] So stupid.
[Daly] That's funny...
"-That's funny. [laughs]  -[Nanette] Yeah, it is funny. It's funny."
[both laugh]
[laughs]
"Easy, Cole."
[panting]
"-All right, I'm in position.  -OK, we're gonna hang up now."
Make the phone call. Be sure to complete  the rest of your mission.
-I will.  -you better.
"-[call ends]  -[Dudani] OK, I'll send it back down."
[Nanette laughs]
Oh! Hi. [giggles]
[Nanette] This is fucking crazy.
[line ringing]
Fenzi's.
"[whispering]  Yes, I'd like to order a pizza."
Sure. What do you want?
[doorbell rings]
[omnicorder rings]
Oop.
I guess you'd better get that.
See who...
[omnicorder rings]
-Hold on.  -yeah.
[doorbell ringing]
[knock on door]
"-It's the door.  -[Nanette] Oh, OK."
[ringing]
-Pause game.  -[whirring]
[knock on door]
[doorbell rings]
[omnicorder beeps]
"-Dudani, pick me up.  -you got it. Stand by."
[doorbell rings]
-[Daly] Coming.  -[Nanette gasps]
[panting]
"-Hello?  -Uh, pizza."
I didn't order a pizza.
"OK, look, someone did, OK?  So do you want it or not? Because..."
-I can't take it back.  -[bag unzips]
[whispers] What the hell am I doing?
-[Daly] All right!  -[door buzzes]
[panting] OK.
-That's the signal. She's got the DNA.  -[jacket zipping]
All of it. Tommy too.
[exhales]
"Packer, we ready to fly?"
Uh-huh.
Well?
"You're supposed to say something  like ""engage"" or ""increase thrust."""
-Just fucking go.  -[engines revving]
There you go.  So I got it here in under ten.
There's supposed to be 30 in it for me.
Yeah. What's happening?  The door is closing. Hello?
Hello? Hello?
[panting] Shit...
"Come on, man."
"Hello? Come on, man, you promised."
[number pad beeps]
[scoffs]
"-Nice. Nice. Merry Christmas, asshole!  -[thud]"
[scoffs]
[muttering]
[panting]
[gasps]
Resume game.
Resume game.
Can't we go any faster? That dud disk  isn't gonna fool him forever.
"The update is gonna complete before long  and that means bye-bye, wormhole."
The only quicker route  is through that asteroid belt there.
"-Let's go that way.  -No, it's way too dense."
"If the ship broke up we wouldn't die,  we'd just be left in space."
Until Daly works out what's happening.  Then he'll find us and he'll fuck us over.
[clattering]
-Resume game.  -[device beeps]
"Lieutenant Cole, we should head..."
Cole?
Daly to bridge. What's going on?
"-shit. He has a backup disk.  -Come in, bridge."
"No, don't answer him."
Dudani?
God damn it.
"The wormhole, it's decreasing in size."
Upload must be in the last few percent.
"Damn it, Packer,  we are gonna have to go through the belt."
Do you think that you can do that?
-think I can try.  -OK.
[engine revving]
"-Ship's computer on.  -Computer, where's the USS Callister?"
USS Callister is on course.
-on course for where?  -the wormhole.
-What wormhole?  -the update vortex.
Sons of bitches!
-Prepare for takeoff.  -[whirring]
I've got a heat signature. Looks like  a shuttle took off from Skillane IV.
"Oh, God, it's Daly."
[all groan]
Shields at 86%.
[banging]
[Dudani] We're taking a beating here!
[Tulaska] Incoming transmission.
"[Daly] Hello? Loyal trusty crew, come in."
I know you can hear me.
"Whatever it is you think  you're going to do won't work,"
but it is going to cost you!
-[Nanette] Let's go faster.  -Already at maximum.
"Daly can't touch us unless he makes it  on board, and that's shuttle's a jalopy."
-He won't catch us in time.  -I hope you're right.
Shields 58%.
[crashing]
"If you thought what happened to you  in the past was bad, that was nothing!"
What I'm going to do to you  is going to be goddamn fucking biblical!
I'm literally going to turn  your insides out.
But I'll keep you alive  in tiny little jars
and there you'll stay  until I'm bored of you--
"-Why are we listening to this?  -Yes, fuck him!"
[beeps]
We're at the edge of the belt.  I think we're gonna make it.
-[crashing]  -[alarm sounds]
[power dies]
-[gasps] What was that?  -[Dudani] Primary drive.
I've lost all thrust.  Engines not responding.
We're drifting here.
-USS Callister has lost engine power.  -[laughs]
I'm coming to get you! Hello! [laughs]
[Nanette] Is there any way  that we can fix the engines?
"That's only feasible manually,  by climbing inside the jet fader."
[Nanette] So...?
So you'd burn to a crisp  when the jet came on.
-[Dudani] We'd burn without dying.  -So one of us needs to go. OK.
[Walton over speaker]  One of us already has.
Walton?
I'm pretty sure I can fix this.
"Um, uh... Walton, are you sure about this?"
I'm sure. [echoing]
"Tulaska, can you patch me through  to Daly?"
[Tulaska] Patching through.
"[Walton panting]  Hey, Daly, can you hear me?"
-Walton?  -Robert? Hey.
"-Walton, you're going to pay for this.  -Robert, listen."
"-I'm going to bring Tommy back in.  -Hey, Robert--"
"God so help me, you are going to regret  all of this so hard!"
"Bob, I wanna talk to you here!"
I was thinking I should say...
sorry.
Go on.
You created Infinity.  You're a fucking genius.
I exploited that.
"I treated you like a golden goose  and I got fat on the profits,"
figuratively speaking.
[exhales]
"And I was thinking I should have  appreciated you more, you know?"
I should have treated you better.
"Yeah, yeah, I was thinking  I should say all that."
[Walton exhales]
"But you threw my son out of an airlock,  so fuck you to death."
[screams]
[screams echo]
Walton?
Walton?
-[power boots up]  -[engine whirring]
We've got power back.
-Faster!  -[computer] Speed already at maximum.
"I don't care, whatever, just catch them!"
[alarm beeps]
Wormhole almost closed.  Daly's gaining on us.
-Keep her steady. Keep steady.  -I'm trying.
"Come on, come on."
I hope we are going to die.
Goddamn it!
Damn it! Fuck!
[all scream]
[screaming continuing]
[electronics whirring]
What happened?
The mod's gone.
Daly's Space Fleet mod  has been stripped away by the firewall.
"-OK, so... this is good.  -[Packer] We're still alive."
"[Dudani]  Yeah, it only erased the Space Fleet mod."
[Nanette]  We're not on Daly's computer anymore.
-We're in the cloud.  -[Tulaska] Where is Daly?
"Firewall's deleted his rogue game code,  and his controls were disabled."
-You mean...?   -He's stuck there.
[laughs]
[computer]  Update complete. Wormhole closed.
-[beeping]  -[clicking]
-Controls are disabled.  -No.
"[Daly] No. No, no, no!"
[doors open]
-[Lowry] Assholes!  -[Valdack] Hey!
-[Valdack] Yeah! What's up?  -The brig unlocked itself.
My Valdack outfit turned into this.
"More to the point,  I'm not a beetle thing anymore."
I've got my body back.
I've got my whole body back.  I'm guessing we all have.
So what do we do now?
We've got an infinite procedurally  generated universe at our disposal.
We can go anywhere.
Holy mackerel.

-It says Gamer691.  -That's a player tag.
"Another ship, another player."
We're online. Um...
"-Hey, patch 'em through.  -[beeps]"
"-Um, hello.   -[Gamer691] Hey there."
"Uh, this is the crew of the USS Callister.  [laughs]"
"Oh, man, are we glad to hear from--"
"Yeah, Merry Christmas. So are we gonna  blow each other or are we gonna trade?"
Oh... Hmm.
Hello. Do you have anything  to trade at all?
"-[Nanette] No, uh--  -[sighs] So why did you respond?"
"OK, just get the hell out of my quadrant  or I'll blast you to shit."
"-you got ten seconds. Ten...  -Oh, Well, do... do try."
"We'll photon-bolt you up  the perineum, you stupid little boy."
"-Scary. Nine.  -Come on, then."
"-Yes, thank you, Shania. Um...  -Eight."
"-Nate?  -Yes, Captain?"
Stick us in hyperwarp and let's...
-Six.  -...fuck off somewhere.
"-Five.  -[Packer] Aye aye, Captain."
"-really, Nanette is fine.  -Four."
"-Aye Aye, Nanette.  -Three."
Two. One!
Uh-huh. You'd better run.  King of space right here.
[sighs]
[man] How are the pressures  and saturation?
[nurse] Pressures are good.  Oxygen saturation is 100%.
Feel anything?  -No.
-[nurse] How about now?  -Mnh-mnh.
[nurse] And when he does that?
Nothing.
"[nurse] OK. All set, then."
[surgeon] Making initial incision.  Hand me the Bovie.
We've entered the peritoneum.
I can't believe I couldn't do it.
I couldn't push anymore.
[nurse] Don't be ridiculous.  Don't apologize.
[surgeon] We've moved the bladder.  Here's the uterine incision.
"-[woman] Oh, God...  -Hey, it's gonna be fine."
I won't tell anybody  if you want to hold my hand.
"[surgeon] OK, we're ready now.  How are the vitals?"
[nurse] Still good.  You're gonna feel a little pressure now.
-Uh-huh.  -[surgeon] Occiput is visible
-and... baby is out.  -[laughs]
[surgeon] Cutting the umbilical cord.
-[woman] Is she OK?  -[doctors mutter]
What is it?
What's...
[doctors continue muttering]
"-Say she's OK.  -[nurse] Hey, hey, hey. It's OK."
"Oh, God! Oh, God..."
-[sobs] Is she OK?  -[nurse] Just relax. Hold on. OK?
-[baby cries]  -[surgeon] Good job.
[nurse] She's great.
"Oh, she's beautiful."
[baby gurgles]
[doctors murmur indistinctly]
"One, two, three and open your mouth  and eat this down, OK?"
"One, two, three, boo."
"-No, no. Big ""ah"" and in it goes.  -[chuckles]"
"So, that's how it's gonna be,   huh, soldier?"
I'm not a soldier.
[woman] You want me to take over?
I think your mother should know by now  that your grandfather's not a quitter.
"-[mother chuckles]  -One, two, three, and..."
I want to take Sara to the park.  You want to come?
"No, I'm gonna pass if you don't mind."
"I'd like to get at that painting,  get it finished."
"-Mm, the horse?  -Yeah."
-Yep. Have a good time.  -[Sara giggles]
"-[dog barks]  -[Sara] Oh! No, no."
[Sara] Mommy.
"-Here we are!  -[squeals, laughs]"
[mother chuckles]
[laughs]
-[woman] Marie?  -[Marie gasps]
-[woman laughs]  -[Marie squeals] Hi!
[woman] I thought it was you.
-This is Mikey.  -[Marie gasps]
"-Hello, little guy.  -[woman] Yeah."
"Hey, there."
-[Marie] How old is he?  -He's seven months.
-[Marie] Wow. Congratulations.  -[woman] Yeah. Thank you.
[Sara] Kitty!
-[woman] I'm so tired.  -[Marie] Yeah.
[Marie laughs]
Hopefully he'll sleep through the night  one of these days.
"Yeah, well, you're past that.  How old's Sara now?"
Sara is three and she's... Sara!
Sara!
Come say hi to this little boy.
Sara?
-[tense music]  -Sara?
-[man] Sara!  -[woman] Sara!
-Sara!  -[woman] Sara!
[man] Sara!
-[woman] Mommy's looking for you!  -Sara!
[cries]
Sara!
"-Hey, it's OK. We're gonna find her.  -Stop!"
"-[man] Hey, hey, lady!  -Sara!"
[man] I found her!
[pants]
[man] She was down by the track.  Fallen down the slope.
-[Marie sobs]  -Said she... she followed a cat?
-She followed a cat.  -[Marie whispers] I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.  I'm right here.
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.   [sobs]"
-Miss Sambrell?  -Yes.
"And Sara, right? Follow me."
"You have a recommendation,  so Sara will be part of our trial period."
"-Well, it's been tested though, right?  -Of course."
"-I mean, she's not, like, a guinea pig.  -It's all fully tested, perfectly safe."
This is just us fine-tuning our  subscription model before the full launch.
[Marie] Look at the kids.
We're getting feedback on which features  our customers use most in the real world.
-[Marie] Uh-huh.  -Do you wanna go up? Yeah!
"Response so far is just incredible.  The sense of security, peace of mind."
"I mean, the stories we've been hearing,  they're inspirational."
"-[Sara giggles, chatters]  -Can you see the screen?"
"-OK, then.  -[woman] There you go."
-You like cartoons?  -Yeah.
Yeah? Shimmer and Shine?
-Uh-huh.  -Mm-hmm. OK.
Then you watch that  and I won't be a moment. OK?
[chattering on TV]

[device whirs]
[device beeps]
-That's it?  -[woman] Mm-hmm. That's it.
So...
Let's get you all set up.
-I'll run you through everything. OK?  -[Marie] OK.
-[woman] Feel free to ask any questions.  -Mm-hmm.
-[woman] This is your parental hub.  -[tablet beeps]
I'm just pairing it with Sara's implant.
OK. We're all set.
"-[tablet beeps]  -So, this is Sara's current location,"
"which is here, of course."
"[Marie] Oh, look at that."
"Now, if she ever goes missing,  all you have to do is tap here,"
"enter your PIN, and law enforcement  is automatically notified."
"Wow, OK."
-[tablet beeps]  -[woman] These are her vitals.
"Healthy heartbeat. Oh, I see  her iron levels are a little low."
How is she eating?
"[sighs] Man, she's picky.  Um, she hates greens, so--"
You might want to think about  nutritional supplements.
-OK.  -[tablet beeps]
"Now, tap this icon here..."
-[Marie] Mm-hmm.  -...to relay her optic feed.
[Marie] This is what she's seeing now?
[woman] That's right.
-Whoa. [laughs]  -[laughs]
[Marie] That's amazing.
Mommy! It's funny.
And there are parental controls  you can apply to that.
"-Uh, controls?  -Content limitations."
"If she witnesses something that causes  her cortisol levels to rise, like stress,"
it can kind of paint out  whatever's triggering it.
-Let me show you.  -OK.
[tablet beeps]
-[Marie] Ooh.  -It's OK. Look.
"See, the imagery causes  a cortisol spike, and this..."
-[clear sound effects]  -[tablet] Filter on.
-[muffled shouts]  -...is what she sees and hears.
[Marie chuckles] Whoa. OK.
"Yeah, I'm not sure that we'll..."
-[tablet beeps]  -It's all optional.
OK.
How much?
Nothing. It's a free trial.
"-Oh, free.  -[Marie scoffs]"
-Yeah.  -Yeah.
And it's completely safe.
"I'm sure it is, honey."
"-I am 2,000 years old...  -[sighs]"
...and I remember when we used to open up  the door and just let the kids be.
Mm. And I remember breaking my arm  because you wouldn't get a baby gate.
And how is the arm now?
[scoffs]
Feels OK.
[Sara] Are you there? Mommy!
Where are you?
Mommy?
Are you here?
[giggles quietly]
Mommy?
"-Oh, what's up, sweetheart?  -I'm looking for Mommy."
You're looking for Mommy?  I got no idea where she's at.
Upstairs. Go on. Go look upstairs.
[giggles quietly]
"-[Sara] Mommy, where are you?  -Yoo-hoo!"
"Mommy, I hear you."
I'm gonna find you.
[laughs louder]
"[Sara laughs] I hear you, Mommy."
-[Marie] Ah!  -[Sara screams]

You guys gonna be all right?
I raised you all right. You turned out OK.
"Took you a while, but you did."
"All right, sweetheart. I'll see you later."
Terrorize your grandpa. He can handle it.
[Sara] Bye.
[Marie] Bye.
Orange straw.
"-OK, just push on my hand. OK.  -Yeah. [grunts]"
Relax.
-Again. Is that all you got?  -[laughs]
I think the range is getting better.
"So how long till I can get back  on the bike again, you think?"
[sighs] I'd say two weeks  and maybe don't drive so fast.
"Yeah, right."
"OK. So, same time next week?"
"Uh, no, actually it's got to be Thursday.  I got plans Monday."
Something exciting?
"Girlfriend's folks are in town, so nope."
"-Oh, well, uh, Thursday it is.  -[phone beeps]"
"Oh, I'm liking yours. That's the way."
"You're not shy about using color, are you?  That's the way a real artist..."
[Sara] I'm gonna try this...
"[exhales] Sorry, honey. Just, uh..."
[sighs] Grandpa's gotta sit...
[mumbles]

[grunts] Ah!

Huh? Sara...

[groans] Sara...
"Oh, my God!"
[grandfather breathes heavily]
"OK, very good."
"-the nurse left your thing on.  -Yeah, she probably forgot to take it off."
-I'll get it.  -I can get it. [exhales deeply]
[grandfather coughs]
-You good?  -[grandfather] Quit bugging me. Jeez.
[Marie] There you go.
[grandfather] It's warm in here.
I don't need that.
Give me that.
[tablet beeps]
"-[chattering on TV]  -Hey, Sara! One cookie."
[Marie] Bad for your teeth.
[grandfather] Thanks.
[Marie sniffles]
What color for the hair?
Mom?
"Uh, whatever you want."
But I'd say brunette.

[boy 1] He's got his arms in the air.  He's given up.
-He's got a stick out and... [gasps]  -[boy 2 groans]
"-He just, like, pounds on him.  -Turn it off, Trick. It's gross."
What is it?
Great. The walking snitch.
-[girl] She never snitches.  -[boy 2] She's just weird.
"-I want to know what you're watching.  -What do you care, chip-head?"
It's parental advisory. You're locked out.
I want to know.
You're better off not seeing it.  Wish I never did.
What if I tell you what's in it?  That work?
"So, he brings it down, like, wham!  There's all this blood."
You seen much blood?
"It's like juice. Thick, red juice."
"Then the guy on the ground is all,  like, ""Hell, no!"""
And he keeps... [muffled speech]
[muffled speech continues]
"[Marie] Oh, it's too much.  I'm fine to have my face on the flier,"
"but on the poster, it's like,  ""Look at me."""
[tablet rings]
"Sara, what are you doing?"
[groans] Sara!
[breathes heavily]
What's happening in this picture?
[doctor] Are they happy or...
[Sara] They're talking.
[doctor] Just talking?
[Sara] I don't know what about.
[doctor] OK. Next one. [sighs]
-[doctor] How about that one?  -[Sara] I don't know.
[doctor] Is she happy?
"[Marie]  So is this, like, an autism thing?"
"The spectrum is wide,  but in my opinion, she's not on it."
"But what about the pencils,  like, self-harm?"
And these pictures are... [sighs]
Has Sara ever shown  any undue anger before now?
No.
"Well, then consider this part experiment,  part acting out, for your benefit."
[Marie sighs]
The Arkangel never launched nationwide.  It was banned in Europe.
"It'll be pulled here, too, by the fall."
I did this to her.
"You can't remove the implant,  but you can get rid of the parental unit."
The screen.
Just throw it away. Problem solved.
[tablet beeps] Filter off.
Goodbye.
[tablet shuts down]
You're gonna be on your own today. OK?
No Arkangel.
The system isn't gonna be on.
"OK? So, no fuzzy pictures."
And you won't see me?
[sighs] I won't see you.
"But, you do not have to be afraid.  I'm right down the street."
-You won't know if something happens?  -Nothing is gonna happen.
It's important that we do this.
[whispers] You're gonna be fine.
"[exhales] Be good, sweetie."

"-[boy] Don't touch my stuff again, Trick.  -Yeah? I'll do what I want."
What do you want?
Are you OK?
"Yeah, sure."
"My dad's gonna see this and then bust it  all over again, 'cause I got in trouble."
Ever seen a bust lip before?
Mm... Not till now.
She turned the system off.
[Trick] OK...
"-This is porn. Like, people doing it.  -[woman moaning]"
They can't make babies that way.   They have to do it different for that.
-[shouting]  -So this one's got a hacksaw
and he's gotta cut his own foot off.
"-So, the terrorist guy...  -[shouting]"
"...OK, OK, keep an eye on the knife."
See?
-He's gonna take his whole head off!  -[men scream]

You hang on in there.

"-it keeps your stools firm.  -Oh, Jesus, Mom."
[rock music playing]
"Oh, you've got to be kidding!  When was the last time you went anywhere?"
That's not dancing. [laughs]
[Sara] She said he was English.
"-He's not English.  -He said ""cup of tea,"" or something."
Doesn't mean anything.  Susan's an idiot. [chuckles]
"Hey, it's Trick."
"Holy fuck, he's got wheels!"
"[girl] Yo, Trick!"
"Hey, guys. What's up?"
-Interesting hair.  -Shut up.
I'm fucking with you. It's cool.
[laughs]
-How are you doing?  -Didn't know you cared.
Maybe I don't.
"-You a delivery guy now?  -Kinda, of sorts."
-Shut up.  -[laughs]
Hmm... So intriguing. I gotta go.
"Hey, uh, we're headed to Lake Dalston  later if you girls want to hang."
We'll think about it.
-[Trick] It'll be fun.  -[boy] Why don't you just come?
Come on!
[girl] Like my dad's gonna let me  set foot in Trick's van.
"[Sara] Look, we tell our folks  we're at Reilly's for movie night."
"Oh, come on, it'll work."
"It's worth a shot, I guess."
"So, anyhow..."
"-You and, Uh, Trick, huh?  -What?"
[scoffs] I'm not gonna do anything.
"-Yeah, OK. [laughs] Sure.  -Oh, fuck you!"
[laughs] Hey!
[laughing]
-[door opens]  -Yay! You're home.
Not for long. I was gonna go to Reilly's  with Meryl. Movie night.
"Oh, I thought movie night  was on Wednesday."
"Her mom's got guests over then,  so we're doing tonight."
Gonna watch some vintage thing.  The Breakfast Gang.
[laughs] The Breakfast Club.
[laughs] That's it.
"Um, be home, like, 11:30.  Her mom will drop me back."
"Well, I might be heading out, too. So..."
"-Really?  -Yeah, really."
OK. Last one home's a rotten egg.
OK!

She called me fat. I got over it.  I still remember it... [laughs]
"-Would You like some?  -Yeah, sure."
"[coughs, laughs]"
[Trick laughs]
-[laughs] What was that?  -[boy] I heard it.
[chuckles]
-[Sara moans]  -Cold?
Only a bit. [sighs]
[Trick] Come here.
"[moans, sighs]"
It's late.
I should go.
Same time next week?
[kisses]
"[voicemail] Hi, it's Sara.  Leave a message. Make it good."
"Hey, it's Mom. All right, call me."
"OK? All right, bye."
[phone beeps]
"-[woman] Hey.  -Hi, Ava. I was just wondering"
if the girls were done with the movie.
[Ava] What movie?
-Breakfast Club?  -They never ended up here.
-They didn't?  -No. Do you want to speak to Reilly?
I don't know.  I must have got my wires crossed.
"-OK, thanks.  -all right."
"-[woman] Hello?  -Hi, it's Marie."
I was wondering  if Sara and Meryl were together.
They said they were headed down  to Reilly's.
"No, I haven't seen them."
"-Hi, it's Marie, Sara's mom.  -[man] Oh, hi."
"-Yeah, I was just--  -What's up?"
-Have You heard from her?  -Uh... No.
"I'm sorry, I know it's late.  I was wondering, have you seen her?"
"-[woman] No. Everything OK?  -No, everything's fine."
"[voicemail] Hi, it's Sara.  Leave a message. Make it good."
"Um, hey, it's Mom.  Where are you? Call me."
"[voicemail] Hi, it's Sara.  Leave a message. Make it good."

[Sara] Fuck me harder.

[Sara] Fuck me.
"-Oh, God, oh...  -[Sara moans] Please."
-[tablet beeps]  -Oh.
[whimpers] Oh.
[sighs]
[sobs] Oh...
[Sara] Here. Let me do it.
-My hands are warm.  -[exhales]
-You gotta be a liar.  -What?
You said you'd never done that before.
No way you never done that before.
Swear to God.
"You know, you didn't  have to talk like that."
Like what?
Like the porn stuff.
"I mean, like, you don't   have to talk like that... for me."
OK.
-[laughs]  -What?
[chuckles] Just... just you.
What about me?
You know...
"You've got muscles, but..."
[whispers] ...you're a pussy.
-Yeah.  -[both laugh]
[loud knock on door]
I'm busted.  My mom knows I'm not at Reilly's.
"-Huh?  -[Meryl] Yeah, I mean..."
"We gotta go, OK?"
-Come on.  -Fuck.
[sighs]
[dog barks in distance]
[Sara] No lights. [sighs]  Maybe she's still out.
Pretty sure she had a date.
Maybe she got laid.
"-[snorts, laughs]  -[laughs] Oh, please, that's gross."
-Sorry.  -Check out that laugh. [chuckles]
-Yeah? [laughs]  -[laughs] Yeah.
Later.
[chuckles]
-[door closes]  -[tablet beeps]
Sara?
"-Sorry, Mom. I am a little late.  -It's OK."
How was Reilly?
She's great.
I gotta go to bed.
"-OK.  -Night, Mom."
I love you.
[bedroom door shuts]
[sighs]
"Hmm, probiotics."
I gotta go. I'm gonna be  a little late back from school.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Said I'd help Meryl with a project.   She's being a dork about it, so..."
-OK.  -See ya!
Bye!
[door slams]
"-[Marie] Have a good afternoon.  -[woman] Thank you, dear."
[sighs]
All right. What do you think?
"OK, that's awesome,  but I can't put that on the van."
"-Why not?  -Well, A, it's not my van,"
"and, B, it's better if I'm anonymous."
For your special delivery?
"Maybe, yeah."
-You got any on you?  -any What?
"Oh, come on, Trick.  I'm not dumb. I know what you sell."
You got any?
It's not for you.
Bet it's in your backpack.
"-[giggles] Under the seat... with tape.  -Sara, come here."
"-Hey, Sara, give me that.  -Duct tape."
"Give me that. No, no, no."
"-[squeals] I bet it's in the pocket.  -Come on, give me that. No!"
"I'm making a little money on the side  so I can move out, OK?"
It's not like I use that shit.
Have you tried it?
"Of course I've tried it but, I mean,  it's not even good coke,"
"it's, like, average."
It's for people who like to talk about  themselves all the time. Yada yada yada.
-show me what it looks like.  -Mm-mm.
Come on. I just want to see.
Please.
Are you sure it's not sugar?
-Go away.  -[both laugh]
"So, one of the things people do  is they put it, like..."
"-under their gum, bottom gum.  -OK."
So...
"Oh, ew..."
-[retches] Gross.  -[both laugh]
"All right, let's, uh, let's put it back."
-I don't think you should--  -I want to try some.
"Just a little, just once."
Just once.

Excuse me? Are you Ryan Tribecky?
-You stay away from my daughter.  -Uh... I don't know what--
Sara. You know exactly  what I'm talking about. You stay away.
"-OK, she's--  -She is 15, you junkie piece of shit."
You want the cops in on this?
-I didn't do anything.  -I will show them what you did.
"OK, you stay away from her,  or I will show them this. OK?"
You still got that system?
"Yes, I have it. So whatever she sees,  I see, and I am watching you."
-OK.  -So You stay away.
"OK, if she calls you, you hang up."
"If she comes to see you,  you tell her to get away."

[Sara scoffs] Look at me.
-Why can't you just look at me?  -It was a mistake.
It didn't seem like a mistake  from where I was laying.
I can't be with you.
What the fuck?
[Trick] I don't want to be with you.
"I don't want you, OK?"
You know what?
Fuck you.

"OK, so why is he so down?"
Oedipus says things like:
"""Let the storm burst,  my fixed resolve still holds."" Or:"
"""Nothing can make me other  than what I am."""
He still holds himself  morally responsible.
He doesn't blame fate  for what's happened to him.
"Moral responsibility implies the existence  of free will,"
but actually... [continues indistinct]

"[Sara vomits, coughs]"
-You feeling any better?  -Uh-huh.
"So, listen... [sighs]"
"I had to run some tests,  in case we had a noro outbreak here."
"Honey, it was the EC pill  that made you sick."
-EC?  -Emergency contraception.
For terminating your pregnancy.
[scoffs] There's no...  There's no pregnancy.
"Seriously, I'm... I'm not..."
I can't... I haven't...
"I understand, sweetheart."
"And it will work,  in spite of the vomiting."
You don't have to worry about that.
You're not pregnant anymore.
"I gotta put it in your file,  but I don't have to flag it."
And I want you to know I got your back.
[tablet beeps]
[heavy breathing]
[Sara sighs] Please.
Sara?
Sara?
[tablet beeps]
[tablet beeps]
You watched me.
"No, I... honey..."
-Honey...  -You watched me with him.
"-I... No, I didn't mean to.  -Give it to me."
-[strains]  -Give it...
I was trying to protect you.  I was trying to keep you safe.
[Sara] How do you turn it off?
"-Everything I've done, I've done for you.  -[tablet malfunctions]"

Shut up!

They'll put me in a cell  and fucking keep me there.

"I need to fucking think, OK?  [whimpers] I need to think."

[Mia] Hello?
-[Rob] It's me.  -Hey. Hey.
"-Did your chin catch Dutch fur disease?  -[Rob] Yeah, fuck you."
[laughs]
I didn't say I didn't like it. Come in.
"What's it been?  It's been like two years now, hasn't it?"
"Uh, three."
"Dropping in on my hotel room,  it must be important."
"-Shall we find somewhere to eat?  -Yeah, well, I..."
I got in touch 'cause I saw that  you were in town
"for what is it,  some, some architecture thing?"
"It's a forum, they call it."
People actually pay to come  and listen to me talk. [scoffs]
Imagine that.
Almost does my head in. [laughs]
And you're looking good.  Is that the gym?
"Well, you look--"
"I look like dog shit, Mia.  I'll save you the bother."
Dried-up dog shit.
-[Mia] Do you want a drink?  -I knocked it on the head.
"What, you quit, like fully quit?"
"[Rob] Nine months, three weeks, two days."
"Well done. Well, that's great."
You go ahead.
"-Really, go on.  -you sure?"
-Absolutely.  -OK.
[Mia] You picked a terrible place  to come see me 'cause it reeks of hops
all the way down the street outside here.
-Did you notice that?  -[Rob] No.
"-[Mia] It's like a full-on beer smell.  -[bottle opening, fizzing]"
"Can't help your sobriety, that."
"But I probably shouldn't be talking  about booze, should I? [sighs]"
"Rob, I hope you're not here  to talk about what I--"
"It's about that, yeah."
"I've been thinking about it again,  that night."
-[Mia] Rob.  -I can't not think about it.
We said that we'd put it out of our minds.
Weren't we just gonna try and keep it out?
[Rob] I can't. I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.
"Well, in here, it's now."
"Yeah, I know."
Why today?  Why is it preying on your mind today?
-[Rob] There's a news story.  -A news story?
[paper rustles]
"Uh, a featured article.  Well, whatever you call it."
[stammers] I printed it for you.
Mia?
That-- That's her. It's his wife.
-You don't know that's his wife.  -There is a photo of him at the bottom.
It's him.
"And the poor cunt, they never found him."
So she never remarried.
She never fucking moved house.
She stayed where she is  in case he came back.
"All this time, Mia,  she's still waiting for him."
That's dreadful. But what can we do?
I'm gonna write her a letter.
-No.  -Anonymous.
"-I Am not gonna mention you.  -Rob, No."
"You'll open up God knows what,  you'll just rake it all up."
"-[stammers] I can't live with it, Mia.  -There's things they can do."
'Cause they can trace it back.
"They can trace it.  They'll find the body, they'll find us."
"-They won't find us.  -Yes, they will, then we're fucked."
"Look, when I quit alcohol,"
they told me to make amends  with anyone I've ever hurt.
Who have I hurt more than her?
Also say you're not supposed  to hurt anyone else. What about me?
"-What about her?  -No, No, No."
No.
No! Fuck!
"[exhales, whimpers]"
It was your idea.  It was your fucking idea!
"-[Rob] I know. I know, and I'm sorry.  -[sobs]"
"Fifteen years, 15 years,  the fucking shame, the fucking guilt!"
"I've got somewhere. I've got a life.  You don't know, don't understand."
"[Rob] That's not the point, though."
-You don't understand.  -[scoffs]
You're not married.  I've got a son. He's nine years old.
"You've seen photos of him.  Think of him, please."
I'm sorry.
[Rob sighs]
I sat on this for you.
-I fucking sat on this for you!  -I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
"Hey, look at me."
[sniffles]
[sighs]
Look at me.
"I've made up my mind,  and that's how it is."
"Please, please, please."
"Please, please, please, Rob.  Hey, listen, I understand. I understand."
Do you?
"Yeah. Come on, let's talk about this."
"No, no, I can't stay here."
"-[Mia] No, no, no, no.  -What are you doing? Let go!"
"Mia, I'm fucking leaving."
[Rob] What are you doing?

"Exactly. No, Ali's gonna love him."
"It's just we've got a lot going on,  what with Ali and..."
I'll take him back. The pet shop guy  was OK. It won't be a problem.

"I'm from Realm Insurance,  about the pizza van accident."
"[man] Oh, come in."
"[woman] I mean,"
"it'll cover you for up to four months,  but that is quite a substantial claim."
"Well, I was heading off on tour  with the Philharmonic next week."
"Europe, Middle East, Australia."
-not now.  -Mm.
"As I'm sure you appreciate,  with a payout of this size,"
"-we will need to investigate the accident.  -Yeah, of course."
"Now, that stretch of the street has  a security camera, vandalized,"
"by some kids, I'm guessing,   paintballed right in the wrong place."
"But the, um..."
delivery van thing must've had a camera.
"-Not working.  -Oh, for God's sake."
"No, that's actually good for your claim.  Fences Pizza's a big company."
They've been claiming  their driverless fleet has a good record.
[man scoffs]
"The malfunctioning camera,  that's a step toward negligence."
"So if we can prove full liability,  you could also consider filing"
a substantial civil case  under our litigation wing?
Could be a lot of money.
"Yeah, OK, I'm sold."
Great. [chuckles]
"Now, I'll just hook you up"
-to the recaller here.  -[whirring]
-[man] It's one of those memory dredgers?  -[bleeps]
"[woman laughs] We prefer ""corroborators."""
"-[man] Police things, aren't they?  -Mm... Not since last year."
We all have them now.
Right.
-May I?  -Yeah.
-[man] I feel like a specimen.  -[laughs]
"[suctions, bleeps]"
"[woman] So, this accesses engrams,  your memories of what happened."
"Now, they're subjective."
"They may not be totally accurate,  and they're often emotional,"
"but by collecting a range of recollections  from yourself and any witnesses,"
we can help build a corroborative picture  of the whole.
[man] I don't remember anything.  It's a total blank.
"Oh, I've got something that might help."
"[man] What, getting drunk?"
The accident happened a few hundred  meters from the Castle Port Brewery.
[bottle fizzes]
The whole area smells like a pub.
"No sipping, just take a sniff."
"Aroma's a great memory boost,  helps anchor you"
-to where you were.  -[sniffs]
Oh... that's familiar.
"OK. Now, hold that smell in your mind,  close your eyes and picture the street."

-Yeah. I went to a sort of comic shop...  -[static whirring]
[man] Culty stuff. Um...
I think it started snowing  when I came out.
"Heavy snow, um..."
There was music from a car.
"-[bleeping]  -[""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is"" playing]"
I like that song.
[man] There was a woman in a yellow coat  coming towards me.
[woman] Good recall on her face.
She had this weird lipstick on.  It stood out.
And she's pretty.
"-[music continues]  -Um, yeah, yeah, and that, too."
"Well, the more emotional your response,  the more vivid your memory of it is."
"So there was the music and a girl,  and then what happened?"
"[man] Well, I went to cross the road,  wasn't really thinking about anything,"
"-and, uh...  -[car screeching]"
And that's just when it just goes. Um...
That's OK.  What you've given me is already useful.
-[man] Really?  -[video rewinds]
"[woman] Well, I've got someone  to look for, Little Miss Yellow Coat."
"-Hey.  -[man] Ah, the wanderer returns."
"-Yeah.  -You don't know how to fix this, do you?"
"Um, yeah, I'll have a look at it later."

"-School musical, Bugsy Malone.  -[clears throat]"
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.
"They've got this, um, sound system  for the backing tracks"
that they can't work out  and I said I'd help them out.
So... I'm gonna be there all day.
"You're gonna die  of loneliness here, are you?"
"[Mia] Yeah, I'll be fine."
"[man] Well, we'll see you later, 7:30."
-[Mia] Mm-hmm.  -Don't forget.
I won't.

I'll also just get you  to take a sniff of this.

[laughs]
"If you close your eyes,  I'm also gonna play a piece of music."
"[""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is"" playing]"

How weird.
Hold those things in your mind  and picture what you saw.
-[music continues]  -[sniffing]
"I was on Stanhope Road,  near the hotel place,"
"looking at flats and stuff,  you know, window shopping."
I saw this guy walking towards me.
I remember thinking  he looked sort of sweet.
"The music was coming from the car,  which pulled off."
Actually that was when  the delivery thing drove past.
[static buzzing]
Fences Pizza?  What sort of speed was it going?
"You mean, was it going too fast?"
Um...
-Try And focus on the vehicle.  -Maybe.
-[woman] Um...  -[bleeping]
[sighs] Um...
I don't know. I couldn't really say.
What about the impact itself?
"Well, I didn't really see it.  I just saw the aftermath, really."
"[crashing, man screaming]"
-[video bleeps]  -[controller clicks]
[screaming replays]
[video bleeps]
A moment earlier  you saw a bright light?
Yeah. Like a camera flash just before.
Just outside the dentist place.
-[recaller beeps]  -Hmm.
[scrubbing]
[doorbell buzzes]
[woman] And I'm assuming  your window glazing's soundproof.
"-[dentist] Yes, we get the odd screamer.  -I won't bother with the music then."
"Look, to be honest,  the memory's a bit embarrassing--"
"-Don't worry, I've seen it all.  -Do you have to use that thing?"
"Look, your memories  will be sealed and private."
Unless they indicate you're harming  yourself or another person.
Go on then.
"[suctions, bleeping]"
[sighs]
[recaller bleeping]
[crunches on candy]
[static bleep]
[dentist] I'd had a patient.
"Hmm, so I see."
"[dentist] She left around six, I think."
I stayed to clear up.
You saw something from the window?
[dentist sighs]
There was a guy in the hotel window.
"Well, what can I say?"
[dentist] He was picturesque.
[controller clicking]
[woman] Did you take a photo?
"-[candy crunching]  -[dentist] Well, I tried to."
"I left the flash on by mistake,  so all I got was the reflection."
[camera shutter clicks]
-[woman] And then?  -I was going to take another one.
I saw some woman staring at something.
"So I looked down,  it was just a load of commotion."
[dentist] There was a woman  in a sort of lime coat.
"[crunching] Hmm, yellow actually."
"-[dentist] Well, I knew it was vivid.  -Well, memories can be subjective."
"What we do is build up an overall average,  a crowd-sourced picture of reality."
[recaller bleeps]
Did you see the vehicle  that hit the pedestrian?
Any sense of its speed?
"I didn't see the actual crash, sorry."
"[beeping, whirring]"
OK. [exhales]
-You won't tell anyone about the photo?  -[recaller bleeps]
Don't need to put that in my report.
It's safe with me.
[hotel clerk] That'd be room 304.
Can you tell me who stayed there?
"-You're not the police?  -No, but..."
Then you'd have to lodge  for an information request for that.
But that could take up to a week  to process.
"Sorry, management's an ass about it  ever since that thing"
"with what's-his-name,  the judge of Hot Shots?"
"Anyway, he got caught with a rent boy  and, um, a tabloid got his name"
"by hacking our booking system, and yeah,"
they're tight as anything  about the rule now.
"Oh, the woman I'm after  hasn't done anything."
I just think she might have  seen something outside
yesterday evening about 6:30.
"Oh, I can..."
I can tell you that she wasn't outside...  and I know what she was looking at.
[gentle scoff] How so?
"I can't tell you who she is but, um,  she's into interesting films."
"We log the in-house movies that people  watch and, um..."
her choice stood out.
Oh. [laughs]
-How nice for her. Thanks.  -[laughs]
[seagulls squawking outside]
[computer bleeps]
"Oh, bless you."
[man] How's the pizza accident going?
[woman] Hmm. A pain in the ass.
Can't pinpoint liability 'cause no one  agrees on the speed of the bloody thing
and I can't find anyone  who actually saw the impact.
"Well, not yet."
[sighs]
"Except maybe smudge face here,  whoever she is."
"-[computer bleeps]  -[woman] Oh, bingo."
"Mia Nolan.  You might be the one, if you'll talk."
"What, if she'll talk?"
"She was doing something embarrassing  in the hotel room,"
watching a porn film.
She might not want me  poking around in her head.
[man chuckles]
"She's, like, 50 miles out of town.  Do you mind if I head there now?"
It's a bit late.
"Oh, if I sew this up in 24 hours,  I get two times bonus."
Well...
Go. Go.

"Hi, I'm Shazia. I'm from Realm Insurance."
"-I've already got insurance, thanks.  -[Shazia] I'm not selling anything."
"I'm following up on an incident  you might've seen, a road accident."
I don't know anything about an accident.
[Shazia] This was only yesterday.
-[Mia] An accident?  -On Stanhope Road.
"Medina Plaza Hotel, a pedestrian  was hit by a delivery vehicle,"
"Fences Pizza, driverless."
Um... [laughs]
"Right, yeah. I'm sorry, actually I did."
"When you first mentioned it, I just didn't  think of it, but um... yeah, I did."
So you saw what happened?
"[Mia] Uh, yeah,  there was a guy crossing the street"
"and this little van thing sort of just  clipped him, it was quick."
[Shazia] Do you mind if I ask you a few  questions about it? It won't take long.
"I'm sorry, I'm really busy. I've got..."
[Shazia] I don't wanna sound heavy but  it's a legal requirement since last year.
It's a legal requirement?
"Well, if you've witnessed  an incident, yes."
"I have to notify the police  when people refuse,"
"and when they get involved,  it just drags everything out, so..."
[Mia clears throat]
-Come in.  -[sighs] Thank you.
"Yeah, just that way."
[recaller firing up]
[beeping]
[Shazia] OK.
-What does that do?  -[Shazia] The recaller?
Just helps me get a record  of what happened.
May I?
"Well, I can just tell you what happened.  I can remember."
"The van hit the guy, and he fell over,  and then people came to help."
"[Shazia] How fast was it going though,  the delivery vehicle?"
Um...
"[Shazia] See, I just need a sense of that."
"It's sometimes hard to articulate  what your mind's eye's seen,"
but capturing your impression  of what you saw is really useful.
"-OK, but I've got--  -And that's all I'm interested in."
You can read the terms here if you like.
All the legal stuff is in there.
"Look, I don't care what you might've been  doing in the hotel room in your own time."
I'm not gonna ask you anything about that.  Won't go there.
-OK.  -[Shazia] Private stuff is private stuff.
-So it's just the accident?  -Just that.
"[Mia] It's a bit of a long read, isn't it?"
[Shazia laughs]
"-Do you want a tea or a coffee?  -Oh, a coffee would be great."
"-Yeah, OK. Espresso?  -Perfect."
[coffee machine whirs]
Do you mind if I just go and have a pee  if I'm gonna be sat down a while?
"-[Shazia] Yeah, sure.  -OK."
"I ate hotel food, I had room service."
I ate room service.
I was in the hotel room on my own.
Watched porn.
Watched porn.
Saw the accident.
"Come on, focus. [breathes heavily]"
I was on my own.
I was on my own.
I was on my own.
"[suctions, bleeps]"
[bottle fizzes open]
There you go.
Take a sniff.
-What's that for?  -It'll just help your recall.
[bleeping]
-[sets down bottle]  -That's it.
"[""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is"" playing]"
"[Shazia]  The music will help jog your memory, too."
"OK, close your eyes."
"OK, let's start with you  in your hotel room."
You can blame me  Try to shame me...
[Mia] So I was in my room  and I ordered room service.
- ...care for you   -[sexual moaning]
All I need is the accident.
[Shazia] Try to picture the moments  leading up to the impact.
- Anyone   -[man screaming]
I just feel so sorry
[man screaming]
"[Mia] The fucking shame,  the fucking guilt..."
-[static noise]  -[Mia] No.
-[Mia] No!  -[Rob gasps]
-[Mia] I sat on this...  -[Rob] Get the fuck off me fucking--
"[screaming, groaning]"
"[crashing, screams]"
[static noise intensifies]
-[recaller bleeps]  -[Shazia clears throat]
"Well, that's... great."
"Got what I needed on the van,  so, I'll be off."
OK.
[Shazia] That's it. [chuckles]
-So you've got everything you needed?  -Yeah.
"Doesn't take long, it's just  a simple thing with the speed so..."
-[Mia] Right.  -Yeah. Yeah.
"[Mia] Sorry about being short,  it's been a long day."
"-No, it's fine.  -Got a lot of work on. Did you..."
"-So you've got everything you needed?  -[Shazia] Yeah, yeah, got it all."
"-Don't worry, thank you so much.  -I know this sounds silly,"
"but, um, you know, sometimes I just think  mad things, and it doesn't mean anything,"
do you know what I mean?  When you have strange thoughts.
"No, it's fine, like I said.  I got what I needed, so thank you."
"Yeah, but do you know what I mean?  It's not like... it's just my head."
[car engine moans]
[Shazia] Come on!
[engine moans]
No.
"[screaming] No, no, no, no! No!"
[Mia groans]
[heavy breathing]
[Shazia] No!
"[Mia] I'm sorry, um..."
-[Mia sniffles]  -[Shazia groaning]
[Mia] Um...
"I fucked up, and I panicked."
[Shazia whimpers]
Does your head hurt?
OK.
[whimpers]
[Mia] OK.
[sobbing]
What am I gonna do with you?
[sobbing increases]
"I mean, I can't let you go."
"You're gonna tell someone, aren't you?"
[muffled sounds]
"I know, but even if you say you won't,  your recollections are all recorded."
-[muffled] I won't.  -They're not?
[Shazia sobbing] No.
"If I take that off your mouth,  will you promise not to scream?"
-Do you promise?  -[whimpers]
"Forget the report. I'll delete... [sniffs]  I'll delete it, it won't go anywhere."
"I don't know. I tried to delete it,  and I couldn't figure it out."
"I won't say anything to anyone, I promise.  I'll forget the whole thing."
[crying] No one will know.  I won't say anything.
I wish I believed you.
I mean it. I mean it. I've seen things.
I've seen things on the recaller.
"Secrets, personal things,  I've never spilled any of it."
"I'm not allowed to, it's the law."
"It's like confession,  it's like Catholic confession."
"It'll be illegal for me to say anything.  Totally illegal, even if I wanted to!"
"None of that's true, is it?"
"-It is, I swear.  -[Mia] It's not."
It is.
Did you tell anyone that  you were coming here today?
No.
-You're lying.  -I'm not. I swear I'm not lying.
"[Shazia sobs] No, I swear."
[muffled] I swear. No!
"[gasps, screaming] No!"
No!
[recaller fires up]
"-[bleeping]  -[Shazia moaning, sobbing]"
[ear piece bleeps]
[sobbing] No!
What did you do  before you came here today?
-[Shazia crying]  -[static noise]
"[Shazia sings along to  ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is""]"
"Oh, but anyone"
Who knows what love is...
I like that song.
-[Shazia sobbing]  - Will understand
Who did you speak to?
[Shazia on video] Bingo.
"-Mia Nolan, if she'll talk.  -[Shazia continues sobbing]"
-If she'll talk?  -[Shazia] No!
No.
[Shazia whimpers]
-Is that your husband?  -[muffled] No!
[muffled sobbing] No!
No!
[Mia] I'm really sorry.
[screaming] No!
Will you please close your eyes for me?
[Shazia utters muffled prayer]
"[banging, cracking]"
[whimpers]

[keys jangle]
[man]  Everyone's in their costumes already.
"Yeah, please, make sure you're on time."
"-Yeah, I know, love.  -Are you far off?"
"-Remember it starts at 7:30.  -I'm gonna make it, 7:30."
-At 7:30.  -Yeah. [sniffs]
-All right.  -I'll see you outside.
"-See you in a bit, sweetheart.  -OK."

[man shivers]
[piano playing]
[piano continues]
We coulda been anything
That we wanted to be
And it's not too late to change
It's been decided  To give it some thought
Maybe you'll agree we really ought
"Two, three, four!"
We coulda been anything  That we wanted to be
[clapping to music]
"Yes, that decision was ours"
It's been decided we're weaker divided
Let friendship double up our powers
[sirens]
"[policeman over radio]  Yeah, just confirming double homicide."
One adult male and one male infant.
"Yeah, I'm at the scene now."
[sirens continue]
-[camera shutter clicking]  -Who kills a baby?
I don't know.
Probably someone worried  about leaving a witness.
[female detective]  Bloodbath upstairs and this downstairs.
[male detective] But he couldn't see.
Poor fucker was born blind apparently.
"So I have to say, I have absolutely  no idea who I'm looking for."
So it's a good job you're not asking me.
"Come on, let's clear out of here.  Let's let the recall team do their job."
-[camera clicking]  -[female detective] Come on.
[guinea pig squeaking]
[machine whirs]
[forensic investigator] Here we go.
-[guinea pig squeaks]  -[recaller beeps]
[piano playing]
You give a little love  And it all comes back to you
La la la la la la la
You know You're gonna be remembered
For the things that you say and do
"[cheering, applause]"
[mother] Well done!
[teacher] Put your hands together  for this year's fantastic school choir.
What a lovely evening.  Thank you so much for coming.
Put your hands together  for Mrs. Henry...
"-Coach.  -[device] Yes, Frank?"
-Where do I go?  -[device] Proceed to the hub.
Got ya.
[chattering]
-How will I know who he is?  -[device] This is him.
"-[Frank] Hi. Oh, oh.  -[cutlery clatters]"
Sorry. Fork.
"-Amy.  -No, no, my name's not fork."
-I guessed. It was just--  -It's Frank.
-Do you wanna sit? Shall we sit?  -I think it's that or stand. [laughs]
"[Frank] Come sit, yeah?"
"Oh, oh! That's, um... I was on that side."
"-Oh. Shall I...?  -No, no, it doesn't matter."
[Frank laughs]
-[Frank] Why bring it up?  -[laughs]
Sorry. I'm so bloody nervous.
"It's my first time on the,  you know, the system."
"-Me too.  -Oh, really?"
"Yeah, I'm shitting it, mate."
"-Come to mention It, you look terrified.  -do I?"
"-Yeah, quaking with fear.  -Or maybe shaking with revulsion?"
At least you stopped... shitting.
Oh! [laughs]
-Are you sure about that?   -[both laugh]
[Amy laughs]
-Shall we stop talking about shitting?  -maybe order some food? Good plan.
Yeah. OK.
-do you know How we order?  -I think we use these.
-Oh!  -[device] Menu choice already established.
"-[Frank] Oh. Ta.  -[waiter] Here you are, sir."
"[waiter] And for you, madam."
"Well, evidently I'm a pasta girl."
"Yeah, I'm a, uh..."
-[cutlery clatters]  -...fishcake...
[laughs]
-[Amy] Hmm.   -[Frank] Mmm.
-It's good.  -Can I try some?
Are we... allowed to do that?
Fuck it.
"-Yeah, fuck it.  -[Amy laughs]"
-Mm. That is good.  -Mm-hmm.
So... we're both first-timers.
[Frank] Hmm.
"-Shall we check our expiry date?  -Yeah, Good plan."
"Yeah? All right, um,  so I think it's under ""info."""
"Yeah, uh, ""tap to reveal.""  We have to tap to reveal at the same time."
"-OK. So, on three, two, one. Go.  -[devices beep]"
"-Twelve hours.  -Yeah, 12 hours."
"-OK.  -Bit, um..."
-Yeah.  -Bit short.
"-It is a bit short, isn't it?  -Hmm."
Oh. And getting shorter.  I didn't realize it would...
sort of count down like that.
It's sort of sad.
Maybe we should eat quickly.
"-Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should.  -The race is on."
"-Come on, hurry up.  -[laughs]"
[Frank] I guess this is us.
And this takes us to the place?
"Yeah, suppose so."
-After you.  -[Amy] Thank you. [laughs]
[whispers] It's massive.
-[Frank] Here we are.  -[Amy] Yep.
[Amy] Huh.
[vehicle drives away]
-do you wanna open It Or Shall I?  -you go ahead.
-All right.  -Ha!Too slow.
You're a knob. [laughs]
[door opens]
"Oh, God. It's a shithole."
"-You're kidding.  -I am, yeah."
[Amy chuckles]
[lounge music plays]
[Amy] Ooh!
"It's nice. I, uh, like that lamp."
"-Yeah, it's incredible, that lamp.  -[laughs] Fuck off."
[Amy] Hmm.
"Right. That's, uh..."
[exhales]
There's an en suite.
-Shower Or bath?  -Both.
Ah. That's good.
"Uh. Well, I'm...  I'm just gonna use the loo."
"Yeah, I've got to, uh... over here, so...  [clears throat]"
Yeah.
[Amy clears throat]
"OK, seriously, what are we meant to do?"
[device] Query too broad. Please narrow.
"Well, I mean, are we just meant to...  I don't know, like, just go at it?"
"-[device] Define ""go at it.""  -[scoffs]"
Fucking hell.
"So, are we meant to just  have sex with each other?"
[device] Participants are not required  to take any specific action.
"Yeah, but I mean we can, right?"
"I mean, people do  if it's just a short time?"
[device] If that's your decision.
-It's up to us?  -[device] It's up to you.
[exhales]
I could just sleep here.
Don't be daft.  You'll be scrunched up in a ball.
[groans]
It's not awful.
The bed's pretty big.  I'm sure we could both fit in it.
"Yeah, OK."
Must have been mental before the system.
How do you mean?
"Well, people had to do  the whole relationship thing themselves,"
work out who they wanna be with.
Hmm. Option paralysis.
"So many choices, you end up  not knowing which one you want."
"Yeah, exactly, and if things seem shitty,"
they'd have to figure out whether  they wanted to break up with someone.
How to break up with someone.  Fuckin' hell.
-Just a nightmare.  -It's not like when it's all mapped out.
"God, no. It's so much simpler  when it's all mapped out."
[Frank] Hmm.
"-This is weird, though.  -It really is. hmm."
[door opens and closes]
"-Well, then.  -So..."
Thanks for being my first.
-[devices beep]  -[Frank] Oh. Yeah.
-[device beeps]  -[Amy] Bloody time.
"It was great, you know. You were nice."
-[devices beeping]  -So were you.
"If we had this time again,  you would totally get it, by the way."
"-Oh, you... you bastard.  -Sorry."
"-You'd get it, too.  -Fucked that one up, didn't we?"
"-Yeah, totally.  -[both laugh]"
[devices chime]
I guess I just don't see the point  in something that short. Twelve hours.
[device]  Even your reaction to a brief encounter
provides the system  with valuable information.
[pants]
"Yeah, well, I didn't even do anything.  The system thinks I'm a prude."
[device] The system makes  no moral judgments.
"Yeah, but how do I know she wasn't  the perfect match for me? She was..."
[device] Your ultimate compatible other  has not yet been selected.
"Yeah, I know, but it's--"
[device] The system gains insight  as each participant progresses
through numerous relationships
and uses the gathered data to eventually  select an ultimate compatible other.
"On your pairing day, I know,  and it always finds your perfect match."
[device] In 99.8% of cases.
But I have to go through  loads of relationships to find it.
-[device] That is correct.  -Great.
-[strains]  -[stone skips four times]
-[device chimes]  -What was that?
"-[device] Another relationship.  -What, already?"
"-[device chimes]  -[Frank] What's this, another one?"
[device] That is correct.
"[sighs] I'd best go get changed, then."
-[chattering]  -[music plays softly]
Holy fuck. Tell me that's him.
[device] I cannot confirm identity  until a personal introduction is made.
-Hi.  -Hi.
-[device] Identity confirmed.  -[man clears throat]
-I like your hair.  -Yours is Good too.
-It's all my own.  -[Amy laughs]
It's just funny.
[Amy laughs]
[Frank] Hi.
I'm Frank.
[woman] Hmm.
Nicola. I've been here a while.
"Aye, sorry. I was getting changed."
-really?  -you started already?
"-I was hungry.   -Yeah, course, Yeah. Sorry."
"Come on, let's get it over with.  Checking the expiry."
"Oh! Yeah, yeah."
[devices beep]
One year.
We've got each other for one year?  Could be a mistake.
"-Coach, is this a mistake?  -[device] This is not a mistake."
Jesus fucking Christ.
There'll be a reason.
[Frank] Thanks.
[clears throat]
[cutlery scrapes on plate]
Look on the bright side.  Chicken tikka masala.
What?
Chicken tikka mas-- It's a joke.
Right. So you're the sort of person  that makes jokes.
[puts cutlery down]
"-OK, So on three.  -two, one."
[devices beep]
Oh. Interesting.
Nine months.
Well... cheers.
Cheers.
[exhales loudly]
-[electronic sounds]  -[door opens]
[soft jazz playing]
Pretty much the same as my last one.
-How many of these have you had?  -Relationships? So far? Five.
"-[Amy] Oh. [laughs]  -I'm an old hand, I suppose."
[Amy clears throat]
"Listen, I'm just gonna jump in the shower."
-OK.  -Won't be long.
[Amy laughs]
[soft jazz continues]
[man] Hey.
Hi.
"[man] So, listen, if you're OK with it,  this is relationship five for me,"
and I've found it's best to have sex  straight away upfront.
"Right, yeah."
"Kind of breaks the ice, gives an early  overview of compatibility and so on."
Yep. [laughs nervously]
-So I'm consenting to everything now.  -[device beeps]
Whenever you feel comfortable  doing the same--
-[device chimes]  -[man clears throat]
[panting]
[moaning]
[grunting]
Tikka masala. Just...
-[Frank] What?  -It's a bit tikka masala.
-[Frank] Oh. I'm sorry.  -[Nicola] Talking makes it worse.
[muffled] Sorry.
"No, no, you're gonna have to do it  from behind."
-[Frank] You what?  -From behind.
[moaning]
Bit faster?
More motion.
"Not like that. More motion.  You're all in out, in out,"
like you're trying to shut a drawer  into a filing cabinet.
-[Frank] Sorry.  -It's just boring.
Want a bit more side to side.
Like this?
"No, not really."
[exhales loudly]
[mimics loud exhaling]
-[chuckles]  -What was that?
-Nothing.  -hmm.
[exhales loudly]
[sighs]
[Nicola snores quietly]
[chimes]
[exhales]
Fucking hell.
[Frank] So I can't just walk away?
[device] That is correct.
One day it will provide you  with the ultimate match.
One day. One day.
[chattering]
"[woman] So I'd just like to say,"
"do have faith in the system,  because it does deliver."
-It did for us.  -[both laugh]
"[woman] You have so many experiences,"
"and then one day it pairs you up  with your ultimate match,"
"the best in show, as it were."
-[imitates dog barking]  -[laughs]
Ha.
"So if you're having doubts,  just hang on in there."
-Because it really does work.  -[laughs]
[light cheering]
[romantic harp music]
Garlic dip. Thanks for that.
-[Amy] Hi. Hi.  -Mm!
"-[mumbles]  -Was that, uh, your...?"
-Yeah. Nicola.  -Oh. Nicola.
-[Frank] Hmm.  -Ha.
-[coughing]  -[Amy] You OK?
"No, you're not being...?  Are you being serious?"
"Oh, my God.  OK, this is happening. OK, um, just..."
[spits]
[Frank] Oh. Thanks. [laughs]
[pants]
-you look well.  -Thanks.
"I'd return the compliment, but you've just  spat food on my shoe, so..."
"To be fair, it is a revolting shoe, so..."
All the better to kick you with.
[gasps]
[laughs] Was that really hard?
-Ouch.  -I'm so sorry. [laughs] Fuck.
[both laugh]
-[Amy] Shit.  -[Frank clears throat]
Oh. Oh! Um... Uh...
"Lenny, this is, um, Frank.  Frank, this is Lenny."
"-Hi, Lenny. you All right?  -Hi."
We were together for a bit. [laughs]
"-a small... small bit.  -Yeah, just before we..."
So you two...? Oh. That's... that's great.
"So, I mean... it looks like you two  make a great team."
[Lenny exhales loudly]
Yeah. [laughs uncomfortably]
[applause and cheering]
"-[Frank] Yeah.  -Um, I'll see you."
Yeah.
[Amy breathes heavily]
[Lenny exhales loudly]
[Amy sighs]
[Lenny exhales loudly]
-you know That noise you make?  -What noise?
[mimics Lenny exhaling]
"-do I do that?  -Yeah, you do, quite often."
Does it bother you?
"A bit, yeah."
-I'll try not to.  -OK.
[device chimes]
[Lenny exhales loudly]
[device chimes]
[device chimes]
[device chimes]
[device beeps]
"So it's been great, really."
-Shame It has to end.  -But end It must.
Anyway...
[device beeps continuously]
"-OK, bye.  -[beeping stops, device chimes]"
[device alert sound]
Another partner already?
[device] That is correct.
"So, three, two, one, go."
[devices chime]
Thirty-six hours?
[panting]
"Well, uh... bye."
-bye.  -bye.
"[Amy] Three, two, one."
[devices chime]
[inaudible dialogue]
[devices chime]
[device alert sound]
[device beeps continuously]
[exhales]
[device chimes]
-I just wanna say--  -Don't.
"Well, I learned what it's like to cohabit  with someone I despise."
-Is that useful for the system?  -[device] Everything happens for a reason.
[scoffs]
[device alert sound]
That's sooner than I expected.
[sighs]
-[music plays softly]  -[chattering]
"-[laughs] Hello, you.  -Hi."
[Amy] Hi.
[Frank] Is this right?
-[Amy] Yeah.  -[Frank] I mean...
"Yeah, I didn't think the system  would hook us up again."
"No, me neither. I mean,  I hope it's right, obviously, but..."
"-Coach, are we sat at the right table?  -[device] Yes, that is correct."
"[laughs] OK, well..."
"Wait, um...  Can we not check the expiry date?"
-Uh... Why?  -just sick of it.
"The system's just bounced me from bloke  to bloke, short fling after short fling."
"I know they're short flings,  they're just meaningless,"
and I get really detached.  It's like I'm not really there.
"So the other week, I was with this guy,  God knows who, basically just a haircut."
And I literally had  this out-of-body experience.
"I wandered out of my body,  and I sat in this chair across the room"
"and I watched myself fucking this guy.  And I was, like, what is that all about?"
That is literally just a dick  going in and out of a hole.
"-Yeah, that's pretty detached.  -[Amy laughs]"
"When it's a long-term thing,  it's just as bad,"
"watching the clock like you're a prisoner,  counting the hours, the minutes."
"-Oh, God, I've been there.  -Yeah."
"-Yeah, let's not check the expiry, then.  -Yeah."
-It's a deal.  -Deal.
-[Amy] OK.  -[Frank] Bring on les fishcake.
-[laughs]  -[Frank] I don't know.
[device chimes]
-So?  -So...
-Might as well.  -I suppose we have to.
"-Don't know how much time we've got.  -Yeah, it could be ten minutes."
-think you could last ten minutes?  -fuck off.
[laughter]
"All right. OK, then."
Wait. One of us should  get undressed first.
-Why only one of us?  -It'll be funny.
-Go on then. Get your kit off.  -[laughs]
"No. No, it was my idea."
[Frank laughs]
All right.
[belt buckle rattles]
This is kind of emasculating.
"Well, then, you'd better  make up for it in a minute."
- I'm gonna see your dick   -[laughs]
[laughs] Sorry.
"- I'm gonna fucking see it   -Yeah, OK. Yeah--"
"What if there is no scrutiny, it's just  putting us together in any old order,"
and we all go along with it 'cause they're  always telling us how clever it is?
"Yeah, but it does put people with the one.  It's got a 99.8% success rate."
But how do you know  they're perfect matches?
"I mean, what if all it's actually doing  is gradually wearing us down,"
putting us in one relationship  after another
for random durations  in a random sequence?
"Each time you get a little bit  more pliable, a little bit more broken,"
until eventually it coughs up the final  offering and says that's the one.
And by that point  you are so defeated and so exhausted
"that you just accept it, you settle."
And then you have to live  the rest of your life
convincing yourself you didn't.
Well done. That's one of  the bleakest things I've ever heard.
[Amy laughs] Thank you.
Right. Do you wanna know my theory?  Let's assume the system isn't random.
-It's as sophisticated as they say it is.  -OK.
"Right, so using these,  it slurps up all your reactions, yeah?"
-It builds up a complex profile.  -Mm-hmm.
"Every crazy thought you've ever had, all  your dreams and your weaknesses and--"
"-And your mad theories.  -Yeah, like, everything in your head."
-Right.  -So if it's everything in your head...
"-does it have thoughts?  -All right, so now you're gonna say:"
"[mimics his accent] ""What if that's us  and we're stuck in a simulation?"""
"Well, how would we know?"
-[Frank yelps]  -[Amy laughs]
I think that settles it.
"I might have been programmed to go ""Ow."""
OK. [chuckles]
[Frank chuckles]
[giggles]
"-Hey, come here.  -[Amy chuckles] No."
[Amy yelps and laughs]
"-Coach?  -[device] Hello, Frank."
-I've gotta know.  -[device] What would you like to know?
The expiry date for me and Amy.  I need to know how long.
You're not gonna talk me out of it?
[device] Would you like me  to talk you out of it?
Yeah. Uh... No. I...

"No, I'm not gonna do it.  I said I wouldn't."
We shook on it.

Coach?
-Coach.  -Recalibrating. [beeping]
"What's happening?  Coach, it's getting shorter."
[door opens]
[device] One-sided observation  has destabilized the expiry date.
[device chimes]
-What?  -[device] One-sided observation
has destabilized the expiry date.
Recalibrating. [beeping]
"'Cause I looked at it on my own,  it made it shorter?"
-[device] That is correct.  -Why?
[device] Everything happens for a reason.  [chimes]
"All right, well, undo it, then.  Make it go back."
[device] I cannot do that. Recalibrating.
What if she looks at it?
"[device] Once shortened,  the expiry date cannot be extended."
-[device chimes]  -Why?
[device] Everything happens for a reason.
-Come on. Come on.  -[device] Recalibrating.
[beeping]
-When will it stop?  -[device] It will stabilize
once recalibration has completed.  Recalibrating.
Stop it. Stop it. Just...
[device chimes]
[exhales]
[sniffles]
[Amy giggles]
You OK?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
-All right.  -[Frank] I'm good.
Have you ever had more than four   or less than four?
[Amy] What you thinking about?
Nothing.
[Amy exhales]
"All right, seriously, what's up?"
[inhales deeply]
-[Frank] I looked.  -Looked at what?
We promised we wouldn't. We shook on it.
-Don't you wanna know what it said?  -No. That was the point.
-It's almost done anyway.  -How almost done?
"We've got, like, an hour."
-[sighs]  -Why didn't you tell me this before?
-Didn't wanna spoil today.  -And this hasn't spoilt it?
"It was supposed to be five years,  but now..."
[exhales loudly]
"I looked at it, something happened,  it started going down."
-I don't know what it was.  -So you broke it?
"No, no, no, no, no.  I mean, I don't... I don't know."
Why did you have to look at it?
"Look, I was thinking maybe  we could overcome it somehow."
Why did you have to look at it?
-Because I like you.  -[sighs]
"Like properly, really, I like you."
-For fuck's sake. And that wasn't enough?  -That's not the point.
"-I looked, but that's not the issue here.  -Are you sure about that?"
You're more wound up about that  than how short the time is.
"Yes, because we had agreed."
-Listen. Listen. Listen.  -[Amy exhales]
-What if we just ignore it?  -We can't.
"Listen, we'll just fuck the system.  We'll fuck it--"
"-And do what?  -We'll jump out, over the wall, get out."
-There is nothing out there.  -How d'you know? How d'you know?
-Amy...  -You've ruined this.
You've ruined it.
"-Hey, it's nothing.  -[taser crackles]"
-Amy.   -Don't follow me.
"[Frank] Amy, I'm sorry."
[Frank] Amy.
-[device] Everything happens for a reason.  -[crying] What reason?
[device] The system will be assessing  your reaction
to the painful premature termination  of a treasured relationship
and will adjust and improve its profile  of your eventual chosen one accordingly.
-[sniffs] You're a great comfort.  -[device] Thank you.
[cries]
"I swear to God,  I feel like scaling the wall out there"
and jumping in the fucking wilderness.
[device] That would contravene the rules  of the system.
"Oh, the fucking system. [sniffs]"
[device] Failure to comply with the system  may result in banishment.
"[shouts] All right, I know."
"Christ, will you let me be angry at least?  Will you give me that?"
[sniffs]
[device] You must vacate your current  living quarters when the time expires.
Like I didn't know.
[sighs]
[sniffs]
"And if I hadn't have looked,  we'd have been together years."
She was...
You know when you meet someone  and you just know? You just know that...
Reckon you could pop this in me now?  I've sort of got jaw ache.
"Yeah, come on."
"And after all that,  he never even apologized, not once."
That's too bad.
Do you mind if I think about her?
If I can think about him?
"Yeah, sound."
[panting]
[headboard bangs on wall]
"One, two, three, four."
"One, two, three, four."
[exhales]
[device chimes]
"[device] Congratulations, Amy.  Your ultimate match has been identified."
Your pairing day is tomorrow.
"-Ultimate as in ""the one""?  -[device] That is correct."
-And we meet tomorrow?  -[device] That is correct.
Tomorrow you'll be coupled  with your ultimate match
and together  you will leave this place forever.
OK. [exhales]
Are you allowed  to tell me anything about them?
-Do I know them already?  -[device] Negative.
-Right.  -[device] There is one more thing.
"Yeah, and what's that?"
"[device] Prior to pairing day, you have  been allocated a short farewell period"
with an individual of your choosing.
"A farewell period?  Like, I get to say goodbye to someone?"
[device] That is correct.
Data shows this can help provide  psychological closure.
"Frank, I choose Frank."
[device] Your choice has been registered.
Wait. Where are we meeting?
"[device] Usual booth, 7:30 p.m."
Right.
"-Coach?  -[device] Yes, Amy?"
Count to four.
"[device] One, two, three, four."
"[Frank] Wait, wait. How long have we got?"
[beeping]
-[slams table]  -[beeping continues]
"Look, the system's set  my pairing day for tomorrow."
"-Yeah, Me too.  -right."
"I don't want whoever the system  reckons the one is, OK?"
-I want you.  -I want you.
[device] Failure to comply with the system
-may result in banishment.  -you can fuck off.
Can you remember where you were  before you came here?
[device beeping]
"You can't, can you?"
-No.  -Me neither.
-Why can't I think of that?  -It's a test.
Do you remember the first night  that we were together? How did you feel?
"I felt safe, happy, comfortable."
"It felt right. It felt like something  locked into place, like we'd met before."
"Like it had happened before  and it'll happen again,"
like it's happened a thousand times  over and over again.
"-do you know What I mean?  -Yeah. Yeah, I do."
"Ever since we've met,  this world has been toying with us."
It's trying to keep us apart. It's...
"It's a test, I swear it is,"
and the two of us rebelling together   is something to do with passing it.
-We've gotta fuck it all off.  -[laughs]
Exactly. We've just gotta  fuck the whole thing off and go.
"-Yeah, over The wall.  -right over it."
-No matter what's out there.  -OK.
[device beeping]
So let's go.
"Yeah, let's go."
[beeping continues]

Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music  That they constantly play
It says nothing to me about my life
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side-streets  That you slip down
The provincial towns you jog 'round
"Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ"
"Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ"
"Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ"

Open one of those for us.
You know you're the only one  who can stand these things?
They're the only things left.
[man] The pigs have all gone.
"Used to be full of pigs, that."
"Yeah, that and pig shit."
-Dogs took care of them.  -Don't think I could hack being a pig.
-[woman] I don't think you could either.  -[man] What's so bad about being a pig?
It's undignified.
Undignified?
Walking about with your nose  the same height as your asshole.
-[sniffs] Snout.  -[man 2] What's that?
"Pigs have snouts, not noses."
So it would be your snout  the same height as your asshole.
"Nose, snout."
You're still trotting about gazing up  everybody else's assholes all day long.
What kind of society is that?
An equal one?
[man] So what do you reckon?
Yes or no?
I can give it a go.  You're not gonna be long?
"Five minutes, max."
"[man 2] Oh, fucking hell."
"This is mental, this is."
"I mean, he's dying anyway."
"Well, he is."
"I mean, it's not like it's gonna save him."
"He's got, what, days?"
"Well, if it's what's in there  makes those days easier..."
that'll do for me.
I promised my sister we'd help him.
We all promised her.
Plus there'll be other stuff in there.  Batteries.
-All sorts.  -OK. OK.
[door opens]
[thuds]
[engine stops]
-Leave the keys in the ignition.   -I'm ahead of you there.
"If you hear anything, yeah, don't  fuck about, yeah? Just tear straight off."
-Five minutes? -[man] No more.
All right?
[man] You sure it's gonna be in there?
Course I'm not sure.

"OK, OK."
[groans]
I can't talk for long.
We found a dog at the warehouse.
We didn't see it. We don't know  how long it had been in there.
It got Tony and Clarke.
So they're gone. I'm-- I'm sorry.
[breathes heavily]
And can you tell Ali  that I'm sorry too? [sighs]
She said that we were mad to bother  and she was right.
We... We just wanted  to help her with Jack.
I don't know... [exhales]
Get him something that might help.
I know he's in pain.
[robotic whirring]
"I've lost the dog for now,  but my guess is it's still operational."
"And I'm figuring it can lock onto  this signal, so I'm gonna have to go dark."
"It's, um-- It stuck me with a tracker,  but I managed to get it out."
"I'm gonna have to find somewhere overnight  to hide out, I..."
Get some medical stuff or something.
If I don't make it back...
will you pass a message to Graham?
[cries] Just I love him.
Please would you pass that on?
-[radio crackles]  -[sniffles]
I'm gonna have to switch off now.   I'll try and make it back.

Say I'm sorry to Ali and that she should  give Jack a kiss from me.
I'm sorry I didn't get the replacement  like I promised.
I know how dear it was to him.
And I did try.
We all tried.
I hope you can look after him.

"Oh, how can I forget you"
When there is always something there  To remind me
[humming along]
Always something there to remind me
[singing along]  I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Whoa
"When shadows fall, I pass a small cafe  Where we would dance at night"
And I can't help recalling how it felt  To kiss and hold you tight
"Well, how can I forget you?"
When there is always something there  To remind me
Always something there to remind me
- I was born--   -[engine and music stop]
Mm-hmm.
[door unlocks]
-Hi.  -Hey.
Tours begin at 11. You're the first  in line. Could be a busy day.
[British accent] Road seemed pretty empty.
Nice accent. You from Australia?
"No, I'm from Britain."
"So you got one of those crazy  British names? Esmeralda or, uh...?"
I'm Nish.
-Nish?  -Nish.
"Well, I can't judge. My name's ridiculous."
Rolo Haynes. Owner. Proprietor.
"Well, just us two this morning.  You sure you wanna do this?"
-This place ain't for the faint-hearted.  -I'm sure I can handle it.
Not everyone can.
[Rolo chuckles]
"So, I have to peek  in your little sack there if that's OK."
-Ah. That's OK.  -Can't trust anyone these days.
If you could step through there.
"Anything metal, put it in here."
Cool.
-Mm-hmm.  -Mm. Dinky.
"Oh, yeah. I call it fun size."
Fun size. I like that.
Guessing you had a gut full  of this security shit at the airport.
Our immigration guys  are pretty tight these days.
All clear?
-[chimes]  -OK.
Show on the road.
"So, you on vacation?"
-Sort of. My dad lives out here.  -Uh-huh.
"It's his birthday,   so my mom just wants to surprise him."
And you're the surprise?
"Hmm, part of it, I guess."
-Where'd you fly in?  -Salt Lake.
You came here from Salt Lake?
"Yeah, I thought it'd be nice  to drive the back route,"
but I underestimated the--
Heck of a trip for a girl on her own.
-I don't mean to get old-fashioned on you.  -Seriously?
That is quite old-fashioned.
It's hot as hell in here.
AC must've shit the bed.
Sorry for the heat.
[whistles]
Goddamn digital systems.
"Never trust a guy in tech.  Jesus, I should know that."
[Nish] So what is all this stuff?
[Rolo] Authentic criminological artifacts.
"If it did something bad,  chances are it's in here."
"Take a look around, take your time,  see what pops out at you."
"Anything piques your interest,  I can tell you all about it."
"There's a sad, sick story  behind most everything here."
Just like our main attraction  just through there.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
"A lot of folks  just rush behind the curtain,"
"hardly even eyeball this stuff,"
and then it's a bunch of one-star ratings  on Trip-fucker and before you know it--
"Yo, look, I am not in a rush,  so don't worry."
"Well, then, take your time."
I shall. [chuckles]
"-This stuff looks techie.  -Well, neuro tech was My background."
Sweet.
"So, what's this, then?  Looks like a hairdressing thing."
"Actually, that was one  of my very first souvenirs."
Sheds a little light  on how our main exhibit came to be.
-What is it?  -You heard of Peter Dawson?
-Mnh-mnh.   -Dr. Peter Dawson?
"Well, usually I say  this is Dawson's Symphatic Diagnoser,"
"and folks shriek, ""No way,""  and I'm like, ""Oh, it very much is."""
[chuckles]
"""How the heck did you get that?""  is the next question."
-OK.  -My domain was med tech.
I worked out of St. Juniper's.  It's kind of like a university hospital.
"Sweet setup.  Part of the Land Act, actually."
"It was in downtown New York,  big old building."
"Research up top,"
emergency room and the great unwashed  down at street level.
It was the perfect mix  of business and health care.
[horn blares]
"-Seriously?  -[man] Out of the way, asshole!"
[Rolo] Idea was folks with no coverage  signed up for free health care
in exchange for consenting  to occasional experimental treatments.
I... I... I worked for the guys up top.
"What, like a scientist?"
I was more sort of... recruitment.
"-Yeah, yeah, I'm here.  -Clear."
[machine beeps]
Shocking.
-No.  -No?
"-No.  -OK, I'm going again. Clear. Clear!"
-[machine beeps]  -Shocking.
-No.  -[sighs]
"If I'd known she was on tricyclics,  I would have nudged the dose."
You couldn't have known.
[clears throat]
-This a bad time?  -[scoffs]
Rolo Haynes from the tenth floor.
Seems you've been having some problems.
I think I got something that can help.
The big thing they're into  is neuro technics.
Pioneering brain enhancements.
Neural interfaces.
All that fun stuff.
The holy grail they've been aiming for  is a way to transfer knowledge.
"So one of the teams here  is working on an experiment,"
trying to find a way to beam information  from one brain to another.
[clears throat]
This is Kenny.
This is Hector.
Stay with me on this.
"So, the experiment."
They built a little maze  and they drop Kenny here into it
and he runs round over and over  for months on end
till he knows it like a childhood home.
And then... they put this on him.
"It's a transmitter,"
absorbing signals from Kenny's brain
which were sent to Hector over here.
Hector had our prototype  synaptic receiver fitted.
"Now, remember, Hector had never  even set paw in the maze."
Plan was he'd now receive  Kenny's knowledge of the maze layout
"and, boom,  he'd be able to solve it, first time."
-And did he?  -No.
"Scrabbled around like a rat,  fucking imbecile."
"So, um, why are you telling me this?"
"Because just as it becomes clear  that the maze thing's a bust,"
one of our researchers  spills his coffee on Kenny.
"Hot coffee spills all over Kenny,  so obviously he's squealing like hell,"
but so is Hector.
"Turns out, we haven't discovered how  to share knowledge..."
-But physical sensations.  -Bingo.
That's nuts. Holy shit.
"And even nutsier shit,"
"Hector felt the burn,  but took no damage at all."
"All of the experience,  none of the physical cost."
But how did he die?
They cut him open after  to see if he was OK.
Oh.
"Anyhow, thanks to Hector's sacrifice,  we prototyped this."
A receiver for human experiences.
A neural implant. Only one of its kind.
This is why you brought me up here.
What's the biggest pain in the ass  with patients?
Finding out what's wrong with them  in the first place.
Half of the assholes that roll in here  can't even describe their symptoms.
They're-- They're out cold or concussed  or drunk or dumb
"or... two years old,  or they can't speak English."
"Imagine if you could feel  exactly what a patient feels,"
minus the physical consequences.
Like reading their minds.
So what do you say?
"Gotta hand it to Dawson,  he lept at the chance."
"Like, he was happy to do it."
-[machine beeps steadily]  -And it was only a short procedure.
"Irreversible, but, hey, he was a pioneer."
"Plus, his mortality rates were  in the toilet,"
so this was his best shot at redemption.
Does it hurt if I touch it?
I don't think so.
-[chuckles]  -There's something kinda kinky about it.
It's like the ultimate piercing.
"If you're trying to make me feel better,  it's working."
-[woman chuckles]  -Time for the trial run.
[Rolo] So this is where  our hairnet doohickey comes into play.
"Theory was, if you slipped it  on a willing subject,"
it'd absorb their physical sensations  and relay them to Dawson's implant.
We just had to find out if it worked.
[Dawson gasps]
Ow.
This one.
"Houston, we got a miracle."
"[Rolo] Right off the bat,"
"Dawson gets to work  with the ailing public,"
starts building up a kind of  mental library of physical symptoms.
"Plan was, he'd get to know how things felt  so that he could diagnose them quicker."
"So, starts small in the ER,  minor fractures, that sort of thing."
Soon graduates to bigger stuff.
Major injuries. Diseases.
Late-stage terminal stuff.
Dawson grit his teeth  and went through it all.
Say a kid comes in obviously in pain.
"Doctors suspect appendicitis, they'd  hook him up to Dawson just to be sure."
"Dawson had felt appendicitis  many times by now,"
so he knows if it's something more.
Caught things  they weren't even looking for.
Blastomas and so on.
"Good luck, man."
"That man saved lives, no doubt about it."
"-Good luck, huh?  -Bye."
-Stay in touch. Bye-Bye.  -Bye.
-[sighs]  -That was nice.
"[Rolo] And, incidentally,"
"if you'll allow me to be crude,"
Dawson's symphatic diagnoser  came in handy in the bedroom.
"His implant received  pleasurable sensations, too."
[both panting]
So if his girlfriend slipped on  that transmitting blue hairnet
and he tuned in   his little implant nubbin...
he didn't just feel what he was feeling...
-I'm gonna come!  -...but also felt what she was feeling.
Son of a bitch was experiencing  male and female orgasms at the same time.
"Oh, my... Oh, my...  Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
"-[both gasping, panting]  -Oh, shit."
I can't get enough of your...
But?
-I'm sorry?  -Dawson's having a great time.
"-There's gotta be a ""but.""  -Oh."
"He's having a great time, but..."
But...
-Coming through. Coming through.  -[chattering]
-[man] Come on.  -[man 2] Almost there.
"[Rolo] One day,  they rush in Senator Whitley."
He'd collapsed at some fundraiser.
No one could tell  what in hell was wrong with him.
-[woman] Lift.  -I got this.
[Rolo] Dawson's hooked up.
-[woman] Be careful.  -OK.
[groans]
-Jeez. [groans]  -[Rolo] And has the roughest ride.
-Pete?  -Like he's got no clue what this is.
"-Pete?  -Just one more minute, please."
-Let the man work.  -[Dawson grunts]
"-[Rolo] It's a pain he's never known.  -[grunts, gasps]"
"-Pete, he's flatlining.  -Just one more moment."
And then it happened.
[flatline tone]
[distorted] Pete?
[flatline tone continues]
"Dawson blacked out,  for, like, five minutes."
"Turns out the senator had been poisoned,"
"a rare poison at that,  some kind of Russian shit."
He'd been into that whole thing.
But Dawson had experienced death  and come out the other side.
[gasping]
"At the moment of death, a whole galaxy  of synapses fritzes out of existence."
Tsunami of endorphins.
And then there's this rolling dark wave  of nothing rushes in behind.
"When he came round,  they ran every kind of test"
"and he was all systems go, nothing wrong."
"""Shaken but unharmed,""  they put on his report."
"Next day, he was back up and at 'em."
"But there was something wrong, right?"
To go through all that without dying?
Fucked up his implant like that.
[snaps fingers]
[clears throat]
[exhales]
"Oh, my God."
-[woman panting]  -[sighs]
-I'm just gonna get some water.  -OK.
"-[woman cries out] Oh, goddamn it.  -[gasping]"
[Rolo] Fair to say his relationship  with pain had shifted a little.
"Ah, that hurt like hell."
"Now, he was into it."
He really threw himself into his work  after that.
"He tried to hide it at first,  but thanks to that little nubbin,"
"the more pain he felt,  the more pleasure he got."
-[slapping]  -[woman yelps]
[Dawson grunting]
"OK, no. Stop, stop."
"Stop. OK, safe word. Stop!"
[gasping]
-You said That we could try it.  -And we did.
"Look, we tried the hair pulling  and that choke thing."
"I'm not into it, OK? It's just not me."
[Dawson sighs]
[Dawson panting]
Maybe I should go.
"No. No, please."
I'm sorry.
Stay. Please?
[moaning]
-Ow. Pete!  -[loud moan]
I'm going.
"[Rolo] See, it's like eating chilies."
You acclimatize fast.
"First time you had a jalapeno,  bet you spat it out, too hot."
But persevere and it becomes addictive.
"Soon, a jalapeno's not enough."
"You work your way up, red-hot chilies,  bird's-eye chilies,"
till you get to them Scotch bonnet devils.
Dawson's craving was just the same.
"Before you know it,  he's hanging around the ER"
just waiting for a juicy accident victim  to latch onto.
All he can think about  is that next hit gnawing away up there.
"""Give it back to me. Give it back.  I gotta have it back."""
"Sarah, will you just, um,  file these for me?"
-[Sarah] Sure thing.  -Pete.
-This isn't your shift.  -[man] Take him round to bay four.
-[man 2] OK.  -[Dawson] I just...
Pete.
Careful.
"And three, two, one."
Lift.
[woman] Let me get this.
"-[Rolo] Soon as he jacks in, he feels it.  -[Dawson gasps]"
It's a cardiac arrest.  She collapsed in the street.
I just wanna be sure.
"It's a heart attack all right,  but he says nothing."
Plays for time.
[exhales]
Figures he can ride that pain train  all the way through to nirvana.
Eventually they have to physically  pull Dawson away from her.
"-[gasps, grunts]  -[flatline tone]"
[Rolo] Give Aunt Ethel her CPR.
"She flatlines in front of him,  and he's like an alcoholic"
"watching someone pour  a glass of good Scotch down the sink,"
sick at the waste of good shit.
"Look, we always knew going into this  there might be side effects."
"I mean, we can look into how we  deactivate, but it's gonna take some time."
"I can't just pull all the people  off the other projects, Pete."
"I mean, we have milestones to hit.  You know the drill."
But we'll get there.
"In the meantime,  we can't have you near patients,"
"so just go home, put your feet up  and binge a miniseries, whatever."
No one could have known  what'd happen next.
[reporter]  Authorities are expected to confirm
the body is that of missing  WNL weather reporter Denise Stockley.
"Certainly a major police presence there,  as we can see."
Let's take a look at the timeline...
"[Rolo] Dawson was home alone 24/7,  climbing the walls. Withdrawal, I guess."
"[reporter] She was last seen  the evening of Friday, September 15th..."
[Rolo] He didn't have patients  to leech pain off anymore.
So he started inflicting it... on himself.
[yelps]
"-[exhales]  -[reporter] ...for her safe return,"
or for any information from witnesses...
[Rolo] Spent a week  just whittling away at himself.
"Cut here, a gouge there."
"I mean, the guy was a doctor."
He knew how far he could go  without it getting fatal.
"[soft gasps, crunching]"
[Dawson grunts]
[Rolo] But it was never enough.
None of it was enough.
"When he worked on himself,  there was a crucial ingredient missing."
Fear.
[gasps]
The amygdala.
Little almond-shaped nubbin in your brain.
"When you're afraid, it lights up like  a midnight airstrike, sharpens the senses."
"The fear the patient feels when  they're staring up at that ceiling light,"
"the fear accompanying  each sudden jab of agony,"
"he'd come to appreciate that, too."
It went with the pain.
"Complemented it, like red wine and steak."
"You can inflict pain on yourself,  but not terror."
"For that, you need a volunteer."
[screams]
[whirring]
[screams]
[man shrieking]
[siren wails]
[grunts]
Dawson was practically coming  when they found him.
He'd enjoyed one big old speedball  of fear and pain and death.
Tell me they put him in jail.
In the hospital.
He wound up in a vegetative state.
Good.
Still there to this day.
"In a coma, deep as the ocean."
"But the thing of it is, they say  he still has that look on his face."
Blissed out.
Still riding that high.
"-You're fucking with me, right? [scoffs]  -OK, I added the boner. I couldn't resist."
"-Fun story, huh?   -Yep, Fun story."
Ooh!
"Oh, man."
Do you want some water?
"-Really, I'm fine.  -No, man, it's no bother."
Thank you kindly.
"-[exhales]  -So, how come you didn't stay in med tech?"
"Well, I did for a while."
"Just 'cause Dawson went la-la,  neuro research didn't stop."
[sighs]
TCKR adapted it and fine-tuned it.
"It's how they wound up with  the digital consciousness transference,"
what they call cookies today.
"Uh, like when they upload old people  to the cloud?"
"Yeah, but this was way before that."
We didn't have that whole immersive  VR environment shizzle back then.
"What we dealt with was more organic,  almost lo-fi."
How so?
Gotta say you ask more questions  than the average bear.
"Well, to be honest, my car's still  charging, so I've got a bit of time."
"Well, then,  what I wanted to show you, um..."
Part of what I was working on...
"It's, um... cute?"
"Actually, one of the saddest things  in the whole place."
Doesn't look it.
You ever had one of those relationships
where you just can't get someone  out of your head?
"-Yeah.  -Some years back, boy meets girl."
"Boy's called Jack, girl's called..."
-Jill.  -Carrie.
"[""Spread Your Love"" playing]"
Ugh.
Cupcake?
-Thank you.  -You're welcome.
-Hee-ha!  - Spread your love like a fever
-[grunts]  - And don't you ever come down
-Are You the sheriff now?   -Yeah.
"-And I'm the prisoner?  -You're in trouble, sir."
- Spread My love Like a fever   -Come And arrest me.
I ain't ever coming down
"Eventually, he dick-pukes  a little baby paste up her wazoo,"
-which takes hold.  -[ultrasound whooshing]
"-[light rapid heartbeat on speaker]  -Before you know it, out pops a boy."
Parker.
Boom. They're a family unit.
A walking commercial  for a sunnier future. Happy as hell.
I wanna... I wanna take a photo.
OK. I'm gonna get the lake  in the background.
"-All right, buddy.  -OK, You ready?"
Parker.
Wave to Mommy. Say hello. Say hi to Mommy.
[tires screech]
Carrie gets hit by a truck.
Winds up at St. Juniper's.
[baby whimpering]
[Jack whispers] Come back to me.
[sighs]
Come back.
[Rolo] Years go by.
"Jack visits her every week, talks to her,"
"plays her recordings of their son,  shoots the shit."
She never wakes up.
But they tested the comm box on her.
A kind of basic device that let coma folks  sort of respond back.
I got you some room fresheners.  You want pine forest?
OK.
What about citrus fresh?
Gotcha.
And I recorded Parker singing  with some other kids.
"Uh, you wanna hear it?"
"[children singing]   Twinkle, twinkle, little star"
How I wonder what you are
[Rolo] Hey.
"-Hey.   -The woman in 302, Carrie Lamasse."
"You're the partner, right?"
-Uh-huh.  -Jack?
Rolo Haynes.  I represent neuro R&amp;D for TCKR.
OK.
We're working on a project that might be  of interest to someone in your position.
What's... What's my position?
We're exploring something  that could give the likes of Carrie
a whole new lease of life.
I'm talking miraculous.
What do you mean?
So the guys at TCKR have been working
on digitally extracting a consciousness  out of one brain
and kind of rehousing it in a host brain.
-What does That even mean?  -OK.
"So, even on a good day,  we only use 40% of our brain capacity."
There is this whole other  60% of our noggin
hanging around like an empty Airbnb.
And so...?
"And so with our new  compression technique,"
we figure we can fit another whole  consciousness into that unused space.
I'm talking about taking Carrie's  consciousness from that broken shell
and putting it in there.
What? Um... Like a voice inside my head?
Like the whole of her inside your head.
Like a hitchhiker. Like a passenger.
Vicarious sensations.  She sees what you see.
She feels what you feel.
She can live again.
"-""Feels"" as in...?  -You got a little boy. Parker."
-How do You know All this?  -You hug Parker And Carrie feels it too.
She can hug your son via you.
How much does this all cost?
Won't cost a thing.
"We will have to euthanize her physical  body during the transfer process,"
but we would earmark her organs  for transplants.
Giving back to the community.
So what do you say?
I'd have to think about it.
Carrie's done her thinking.
How about you?
[man] Commencing upload procedure.
[device whirring]
[beeps]
Now moving to download.
[Jack gasps]
"OK, she's installed."
She's home.
"[snaps] You can open your eyes now, Jack."
[gasps]
[groans]
Carrie?
"If you can hear me,  tell Jack what you see."
An... An apple. I... I see an apple.
I can hear her.
-Apple. Apple. She's saying apple.  -Mm-hmm.
"Hey, baby."
"Hey, Jack."
[Rolo] Take it.
Grip it.
"Carrie, you feel that?"
Uh-huh. She says she feels it.
Sensations looking good. Take a bite.
"Oh, God."
So long since I tasted anything.
You can taste that?
She tastes it. Holy shit.
Looks like you're all set.
"-Shall we bring him in?  -[nurse] Come on in, honey."
[gasps]
Is that Parker?
He got so big.
"Oh, God, Jack, hold him.  Hold our little boy."
"Give me a really big hug, please."
[sighs]
I feel him. I really feel him.
Mommy says she loves you.
Truly heartwarming.
"Yeah. But this is where you say ""but."""
"Well, not to wax philosophical, but..."
how long can happiness  realistically last anyhow?
"Aah, turn the page already."
"Man, you read slow."
I like to take in the pictures.
That's what the graphic part  of a graphic novel is.
It's true.
"Hey, uh, I gotta take a piss."
Uh... Ugh.
I'll never get used to this.
"[Jack chuckles] Feels good, huh?"
-Whoa. You're not washing our hands?  -Uh...
Our hands?
"Seriously, though, it's kind of gross."
[reporter] 38-year-old Clayton Leigh  was today found guilty
"of the horrific murder  of WNL weather reporter Denise Stockley,"
whose mutilated remains  were discovered one year ago today.
We should turn this off.  It's disturbing to a four-year-old.
[Jack] He's fine. He's not even listening.
[mug smashes]
Parker! Jesus.
"-Don't snap at him.  -Oh, but snapping at me is fine?"
"-Baby, you're--  -How does that work?"
He's a child.
"This is serious, man. Wha--"
"No, no, I'm not being...  I'm not being unreasonable."
"No, just wait. No. Just--  Just hear me out."
Having a back-seat driver glued  into the back seat
ain't no fun for anyone in the car.
No privacy for him. No agency for her.
-It'd drive you mental.  -Exactly.
"You know, fine, forget it."
"All right, go ahead. Keep talking.  I'm going for the anchovies."
You gonna be quiet?
Hmm?
You wanna shut up now? You're good? Hmm?
You--
Fuck you.
Ah!
Fuck.
Yeah. I don't... I don't care.
"Oh, you... you're still talking."
Hmm? You... Hmm? Oh.
[clears throat]
"Anyhow, soon he or they come to me."
Like I'm their relationship therapist.
"Oh, would you pipe down and let me speak?"
Let me finish a goddamn sentence.
"Hey, guys, I see the problem."
She's the problem.
Familiarity breeding contempt  is the problem.
You need to ration your contact.
Ration how? She's running through my  head like a goddamn tune I can't shake.
"Well, we could upgrade  your privileges, Jack."
Give you a little more control.
Shut up! Sorry. Go on.
"Well, maybe if you had the ability"
to place Carrie on pause now and then...
it'd make things easier  for the both of you.
Do it.
Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Do it.
[Rolo] So he upped his privileges.
-Should be able to put her on pause.  -This one?
-That's it.  -OK.
Didn't take him long to use 'em.
So now we're just openly  checking out women's racks?
-[groans]  -[elevator dings]
"And don't say you weren't because  I can feel the fucking boner forming, OK?"
And he checks her ass too as she leaves.  Holy fuck.
So I checked her out. What?
"I'm horny as fuck,  haven't jerked off in, like, a month."
"Well, I'm not stopping you."
You're looking over my shoulder  but from the inside.
It's like trying to jerk off  in front of a cop who's also your mom.
"-Fuck you!  -OK, you know what?"
That's it. That's it. That's it. Time out.  I'm putting you on pause.
"No. Jack, don't you dare."
"Jack. Jack, I'm warning you."
Not cool.
Don't do that again.
Are... Are we at home?
Why the Halloween pumpkin?
Halloween's months from now.
"Actually, it's today."
How long was I on pause?
[Jack stammers]
"Uh, just a few weeks."
I don't know. Eight?
"OK, I know. I'm... I'm sorry."
I know. I'm sorry. I felt really bad.
"So, um, I got you this."
"Figured it's kind of our anniversary, so--"
Fuck you. You're a fucking asshole.
You want me to eat this cupcake or not?  Orange cream icing.
-Where's Parker?  -Your favorite.
I wanna see Parker.  You had him away from me for months.
I wanna see my boy.
OK.
OK.
[Carrie crying] Where is he?
Hey.
[sobs]
[Jack] What you got going on there?
-is That a fire truck?  -Yeah.
Tell him I love him.
"Hey, buddy, Mommy loves you."
What?
-Tell him I need a hug.  -[Jack] You wanna know something else?
Mommy needs a hug. Hmm?
"Oh, God!"
[Rolo] Parker complicated things.
"They both felt responsibility for him,  so they tried to compromise,"
"you know, reach an agreement, like adults."
"Jack put Carrie on pause  except for the weekends,"
"when they'd take Parker out  with Carrie in attendance,"
kind of like a divorcee  with visiting rights.
[laughter]
[Jack] You go hide.
-[Parker whoops]  -[Jack] That's it!
-[Parker yells]  -[Jack] You tricked me.
-[Parker growls]  -[Jack] Aah!
-[Jack] OK.  -[Parker] Come down here.
[Jack] I'm coming.
"[sounds speeding up, overlapping]"
[Rolo] It worked OK.
For a while.
Hey.
Looks like we're neighbors.
-I've just moved in.  -Uh...
-Emily.  -Jack. Nice to meet you.
"Oh, please."
Hey.
Oh!
-Who's this?  -It's Parker.
Cool name.
Guess I'll see you around.
Yeah.
Guess I'll see you around.
"[Jack] She was nice, OK?"
"[Carrie] Oh, cut the shit. I know  when your hormones are flowing, OK?"
Our balls are brewing up a blow load  as we speak.
I can't. I'm with our son.
[stammers] I didn't hit on anyone.
You know what? Fuck it.  Visiting time is over.
"No. Jack, don't you dare. Jack."
"Jack, you son of a bi--"
"Parker, wait up."
"Anyhow, as time passed by,  Jack got it on with the neighbor."
And Carrie didn't take it so good.
She works all week. We just wanted  to spend a weekend together.
"Jesus, can't you just be happy for us?"
"No, Jack, weirdly enough, I can't."
"Christ, you are so bitter."
No. Why?
-is She giving You shit?  -Mnh-mnh.
"Carrie, stop giving him shit."
Tell her to back off.
-I--  -Tell her.
Jesus Christ.
So the weekend thing isn't working.
And we tried limiting her to an hour--
"But you can tell that she's in there,  like that judging and bitching."
The time frame is frustrating for Carrie.
Carrie is frustrating for us.
You got Carrie on pause now?
"OK, well..."
there's always deletion.
-as in...?  -as in permanent erasure.
-Uh-huh.  -No.
-That'd... That'd be killing her.  -Not legally.
But ethically.
Please. She is just some leftover code  in your head.
It'll be like... like deleting an email.
No.
No. No deletion. I'm not doing it.
She wants to be near Parker.  I can't take that away from her.
There's gotta be something you can do.
My friends...
you're in luck.
It's something we're beta testing.
It's actually aimed  at terminally ill parents.
Kind of like a souvenir for their kids.
Here.
A monkey?
More like a keepsake.
We can put her in here.
In there?
Uh-huh. It's...
"It has a consciousness receptor,"
"kind of like the one we put in your head,  but a prototype."
And there's a camera here  so she can see Parker.
"Plus the whole body's got haptic feedback,"
"so if little Parkie gives it a cuddle,  she'll feel it."
"And she can communicate back,"
"but in a kid-friendly, controlled way."
"Yeah, I don't know.  I'm gonna have to think about it."
I say yes.
"Well, she's done her thinking.   How about you?"
The transfer went pretty fast.
Carrie wouldn't have even been aware  it was happening.
Till she woke up.
"[Jack] Come on, buddy, you gotta tear it.  Tear into that thing."
-[Carrie] Jack?  -[Jack] You almost got it.
[laughs] There you go.
"All right, pull it out."
Oh. There you go.
"What is it, Parker?"
[chuckles]
[Parker] Monkey.
What?
"[Jack] That's pretty cool, huh?"
"Jack. Jack, what the fuck?"
[Jack] But you know something?
"This... This, uh...  This is a very special monkey."
-Mom wanted You to have it.  -What?
"Every time you hug it, Mom will know,  and she'll feel that hug too."
"No. No, no, Jack, Jack,  put me back in your fucking head."
Jack!
[Jack] And this monkey can speak to you.
It can let you know how it feels.
How did she speak?
"Well, the comm setup  was a little rudimentary."
"I mean, this is a prototype."
Jack! [sobbing]
No.
[woman's voice] Monkey loves you.
What was that?
[woman's voice] Monkey needs a hug.
Give monkey a hug.
Monkey loves you.
Monkey needs a hug.  Monkey loves you. Monkey loves you.
Monkey loves you. Monkey... Monkey...  Monkey needs a hug.
"-Yeah, I think...  -Monkey loves you."
-Monkey... Monkey needs a hug.  -[sobs]
Monkey just needs a minute  to get used to how things are gonna be.
[sobs]
"Now, listen, you fucking bitch."
We can still have you wiped.
That what you want?
"Do ""monkey needs a hug"" for no."
Monkey needs a hug.
Are you gonna be a good toy?
Are you gonna be a good toy?
Monkey loves you.
You better.
"[Rolo] Anyhow, in the end,  Parker got tired of his new toy."
But that's kids.
They're ingrates.
[door slams]
Monkey needs a hug.
[Nish] Whoa.
"Wait, so this is a crime museum."
"-Where's the crime in this?  -Well, the monkey is the crime."
"See, a couple of years back,"
the UN made it illegal
to transfer human consciousnesses  into limited formats like this.
"Gotta be able to express at least five  emotions for it to be humane, apparently."
[chuckles]
"Human rights for cookies. Right, Carrie?"
Monkey needs a hug.
She's still in there?
"It'd be illegal to delete her too,  so, yeah."
[chuckles] Go figure.
"Anyhow, ACLU raised one heck of a stink,"
"and so thanks to this son of a monkey,  I was out on my ass from TCKR."
Not even a severance package.
It's why I started this place.
"Had to branch out somehow, and it  appealed to the carny in me, I guess."
Monkey needs a hug.
"Goddamn AC's still not working.  Ooh, it's hot."
But I've kept you waiting too long.
[clears throat]
You ready for the prime exhibit?  Step right this way.
"Listen, I gotta warn you,  he's not the man he once-- [coughs]"
...was.
-[clears throat] Sorry.  -Do you want some more water?
I'm fine. [sighs]
He's this way.
Ooh. [panting]
"[Rolo] Come on, mister! [snaps fingers]  You got a visitor."
[knocks on glass]
"May I present Clayton Leigh,  weather girl killer. [coughs]"
"I know, he's kind of mopey these days."
Cuts kind of a pathetic figure.
But don't feel too sorry for him.
He is a convicted murderer.
Lest we forget Denise Stockley.
Tragic and cute.
"Ain't that right, Clayton?"
Coo-ee!
He's actually looking at you.
Look out. Maybe you're his type.
He looks so real.
"[Rolo] Well, it is him,  or a fully conscious upload of him."
You're probably wondering  how he got in here.
"After TCKR kicked me out, my plan was to  branch out into celebrity consciousnesses,"
sign up famous people and reincarnate  them as holograms after they die.
Kind of like a living Madame Tussauds.
"But celebrities, that's just a quagmire."
"Too many rights issues,  asshole representatives."
But convicted killers?
It's a different story.
[door buzzes]
[clears throat]
"Mr. Leigh, allow me to introduce myself."
-My name is Rolo Haynes.  -They say you're in technology.
"-Uh, yes, That is true.  -So You can look into This DNA thing?"
Prove it wasn't me?
"Um, yes, that's certainly a possibility,  but that's not why I'm here."
-I have a proposal.  -Goodbye.
"No, wait. I have a proposal. I can help."
I can help your family.
How'd you talk him into it?
He didn't need much convincing.
So really it's just signing over  the rights to your digital self
"in case the worst happens,"
and I promise your relatives will  receive the lion's share of any profits.
"So if, you know, God forbid,"
"you do get sent to the chair,"
"you know your family  will be provided for, for life."
-How'd his family feel about it?  -They didn't give a shit.
Abandoned him  the moment he got locked up.
"I know, right?"
"-Jesus Christ, Clay, it's your soul.  -Ain't no such thing."
It's just a computer simulation  or somethin'.
Then why does he need your permission?
"If my pardon comes through,  it won't matter."
And if it doesn't?
"Then if they send me to the chair,  this is gonna pay."
"It's gonna keep you and the kids  above water, maintain a roof over y'all."
"Baby, don't."
This could be a good thing.
But he never did get that pardon.
"Shit, no, 'cause he was guilty."
"But wasn't there some doubt?   You know, that documentary?"
Fake news. Hatchet job.
-What about the DNA tampering?  -Seriously?
There's no doubt about it.
The day he got the chair
was a great day for justice.
Clayton couldn't complain.
"I mean, he was gonna be a pioneer."
I was gonna slurp up  his entire consciousness.
He'd be the first guy on death row  to survive his own execution.
[labored breathing]
[electricity buzzes]
The transfer went beautifully.
"Before I knew it, Clayton was born again."
[Clayton gasps]
"Hi, buddy."
Congratulations to you.
"You're in the afterlife, so to speak."
Looking good.
Am I a ghost?
"If that helps, yeah."
"I just gotta test a few things here, OK?"
So this may seem a little weird.  Just hang on in there.
[Clayton gasps]
What the fuck?
"See, I knew just seeing the guy  walking around captive, that was good,"
but that wasn't much of a draw.
But pulling the lever yourself?
"Now, that's an attraction."
-Hey!  -OK.
"-Hey!  -Three, two, one."
[yells]
Dawson's pain tech  had paved the way for it.
A perfect re-creation
of exactly how the agony  of electrocution feels.
Every volt simulated for real.
[screaming]
"Key was, never let him exceed 15 seconds  at max voltage."
"That would wipe his digital synapses  out for good, kill him."
"Ten seconds seemed to be  the optimum shock length,"
so that became the intractable limit.
OK. Have a little rest.
-[Clayton panting]  -Get used to your room.
Official opening's tomorrow.
[chattering]
"[Rolo] In fact, in the early days,  the problem was fitting everyone in."
"Please don't do it. Please, please,  please, please, please. Please."
Please don't do it. Please.
[yells]
"But, of course, it was really  the souvenirs that were driving trade."
It was beautiful.
"-[Clayton screaming]  -Every time you finished juicing him,"
"out pops a conscious sentient snapshot  of Clayton,"
"not a recording, a true copy of his mind"
perpetually experiencing  that beautiful pain.
Stuck forever  in that one perfect moment of agony.
Always on.
Always suffering.
-[screaming]  -And what you'd call...
fun size. [chortling]
"[grunting, coughing]"
[American accent]  Take a seat if it makes it easier.
[gasping breaths]
"[Rolo gasps, sputters]"
Sit down.
[moaning]
"[panting, cries out]"
[stutters]
What? My accent?
Not fucking British.
Sorry to disappoint.
Who are you?
"You left some parts of the story out,  Mr. Haynes. Why is that?"
You forgot to mention the protests.
"His wife started a campaign,  got some momentum behind it."
"Guess you'd call it  virtue-signaling bullshit,"
but I know it hurt your attendance.
And even the protesters got bored  after a while.
"As soon as it was clear the state wouldn't  do a damn thing about clearing him,"
they just moved onto  the next viral miscarriage of justice
they can hang a hashtag off of.
"But they did their job, right?  This place was on the shit list."
Who was your core clientele after that?
"You lost the day trippers, the tourists,  fun family crowd. Who was left?"
"You again, you pasty-faced motherfucker?"
[screams]
[Nish] Loners. Sadists.
The supremacist sicko demographic.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Out, out, out."
"[screaming, gasps]"
And that crowd's not big enough.
They don't keep the lights on.
"So if someone shows up,"
some classic race-hate rich guy  with a hard-on for power...
and he slips you some extra  for a longer time at the crank...
[Clayton yells]
...you take it.
[yelling continues]
[alarm blares]
Thank you.
"[Nish] Wasn't the same after that, was he?"
Not dead but hardly alive either.
Even the perverts didn't wanna pull a...  a lever on a vegetable.
Where's the joy in that?
"But someone came to see him, right?"
She saw him.
She stood on this spot.
Saw what you had done to him.
Clay?
[Nish] He was like a docile animal.
God knows if he even recognized her.
God knows if he even recognizes me.
[whispers] Dad.
Happy birthday.
[cries]
[sniffs]
[gasping breaths]
What my mom saw that day  was more than she could take.
"She had hoped during the whole fight  to clear his name, but that broke her."
You know what she did  when she came home?
Bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka.  I found her. You fucking piece of shit.
[grunts]
Whoa.
-Is it hot?  -[moans]
"It's humid, right? I'm sorry."
Stupid digital AC.
Easy to hack.
Never accept drinks from strangers.
[whirring]
My daddy taught me that.
"Going by the color of your lips,  you're gonna be gone in 30 seconds."
"-[Nish sighs, sniffles]  -[computer beeps]"
"Hey, don't worry."
We're gonna see you on the other side.
-[device whirring]  -[Nish typing]
[gasps]
[Nish] Hey.
Computer says you're awake.
Congratulations. You're a pioneer.
What the fuck did you do?
It turns out that it is possible
to transfer a fresh consciousness  inside a virtual one.
My daddy's giving you a ride.
"Get me out of here, you fucking cun--"
"I'm guessing you're screaming and calling  me names right now, but I wouldn't know."
"-You--  -I mean, my dad can't talk, thanks to you."
Otherwise I'm guessing  he'd pass on your goodwill messages.
You fu-- You fucking bitch!  You fucking bitch!
"In other news, you'll shortly  be undertaking another first."
The first double-decker mercy killing.
"No, no, no. No, no, no, no."
I took off the ten-second limit  so Daddy'll get a full hit of juice.
Should be enough to set him free.
You... however...
"burrowed away inside there,  Mr. Haynes, you'll feel it all."
-Hey!  -All the pain.
-Fuck y--  -Every perfect little shot of it.
"-Fuck you!  -I'm getting myself a souvenir, too."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"Hey, please, please. I..."
Always on.
"-Always suffering.  -Fuck!No, no, No."
"Bye, Daddy."
[alarm blares]
[clattering]
[yelling]
[door swings shut]
-Monkey loves you.  -Shh.
[yelling]
"How'd I do, Mom?"
All good?
"Just great, honey."
I'm proud of you.
"[Nish] Aw, thanks."
[song resumes on radio]
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Whoa
"Whoa, whoa"
If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender love  We used to share
Just come back to the places  Where we used to go and I'll be there
"Oh, how can I forget you"
When there is always something there  To remind me
When there is always something there  To remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
- When There is...  - When There is...
When there is always something there To remind me
"Oh, always something there To remind me"
"Oh, always something there To remind me"
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
- When There is...  - When There is...
When there is always something there To remind me
[distant sirens]
[pounding music]
[pounding dance music]
Hey.
Hey.
You here by yourself?
-So far.  -Oh.
It's a shame. A pretty girl like you.
"-OK, corny.  -Oh!"
Maybe I can make up for it  by buying you a drink?
Sure.
-Bartender.  -Yeah?
Let me get a Buck and a vodka sidecar.
What makes you think  I want a vodka sidecar?
Maybe I know what you like.
[man] There they are.
Hey!
[men laugh]
Right on time.
"-Hey, Karl.  -Hey, what up, girl? This is Daisy."
-Oh.  -Ooh!
"-Daisy, This is Danny and Theo.  -Hi."
"Hey, lady."
This is my roommates  I was telling you about.
The ones who hooked up just so they can   get the biggest room in the apartment.
[laughs] Very true.
-Let me get you all a drink.  -You're right.
Get your asses on the dance floor.
"-Come on, girl.  -There we go."
"Hey. That little role-play act,  the stranger thing at the bar?"
Got me hot as fuck.
"Ooh. Mental note to self,  my baby's into role-play."
[voice over music] The sound is yours...
You know it.
[Theo giggles]
[voice over music] What do you do  when you dance in a club
and the place is packed and jamming?
[heavy breathing]
[both grunt]
[video game noises]
[game] Round one. Fight.
[grunting and fighting sounds]
You're just in time.
Aww...
"Man, I gotta work tomorrow."
Fuck your work.
New game.
[slightly muffled video game noises]
"[Danny] No. No, no, no."
[men shout]
[Danny] No!
-Fuck.  -[game] Roxette wins.
"All right, man."
"-OK, one more.  -No, man. It's too late."
Decision made.
Shit.
"Oh, look, he picks Roxette again."
But you've been Lance  for 20 bouts straight.
-Come on.  -I know you not bitching.
"-Where we going, Panda Mountain?  -Sucks."
-Crystal Beach?  -Let's go for the Temple.
-Here we go.  -Secret Temple.
-Get ready to get your ass kicked.  -Yeah? Roxette's gonna fuck your head off.
-That don't even make sense.  -Fuck your head off.
What does that mean?
Round one. Fight.
Come on. Come on.
Oh!
[laughs]
"All right, get up, come on. Come on.  Come on."
No.
Get out of here.
-[Roxette] You like? What now?  -Negative.
[both shout]
"-Come on, man.  -[Roxette] That's done."
[game] K.O. Perfect.
[Theo] You woke me up.
Too damn loud.
-[Karl] You want some of this?  -Baby.
"""Baby."""
-Quiet That shit down.  -Baby.
Baby! Baby! Baby!
[woman] Birthday boy!
Birthday boy.  [laughs]
Hey.
Congratulations. How old are you now?
"Uh, 38."
-Forty's a-coming. -Yeah.
"Soon be dead, huh?"
Sure.
-Have you met Simon? -Hey.
Uh...
"-Don't think so. -I don't think we did, no, no."
OK. Simon's into bikes.
That's cool.
-[kids screaming]  -Cool. That's cool.
Maxwell. We don't kick. No kicking.
Look at him. Sorry. I'm sorry.
-Do you like motorcycles or just bikes? -just bikes.
Cool.
[cool funk music plays on radio]
[children laugh]
"-[boy] Tag!  -Tyler, go on outside."
-[bowl smashing]  -Sorry!
-Sorry.  -Let me...
-I'll get that.  -Did he get it on you?
"Yeah, you just... Don't worry."
[doorbell buzzes]
[sighs]
Karl.
"-Hey, Theo.  -I Have not seen you in how long?"
"However long, it feels longer."
Is Daisy parking the car?
"Oh, uh..."
"Me and Daisy,  no, we're not together anymore."
"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
"No, no, no. It's... it's cool, really,  we broke up, like, a year ago."
"No clue. He... I'm not on Facebook, so..."
I can be a dumbass about these things.
"No. Really, it's all good."
"We're still friends. Better friends,  actually. It's all very adult."
"-Well, Come in, Come in.  -all right."
-Danny's out back.  -OK.
[meat sizzling]
"We're not gonna punch,  we're not gonna kick. OK?"
"-I'm sorry.  -Oh, God."
"[woman] OK, go play, no fighting."
Goddamn it. Come on.
Can't beat a little home cooking.
[Karl laughs]
"-Hey, man.  -What's going on?"
"Oh, wow, handshake?"
"What am I, like, infected or something?"
Fuck you.
"[laughs] Come on, get in here, man."
"Ah, that's better,  let it out, buddy, let it out."
"You're still an asshole, I see."
Happy birthday.
"Oh, wow."
When did you start using gift bags?
The store did that.
You gonna open it?
-Striking Vipers.  -X. Striking Vipers X.
Newest instalment.  Came out just yesterday.
"I was in the store,"
I saw it and...
"Oh, man. [laughs]"
This takes me back.
It says here  you need one of those VR add-ons.
"-I don't have one of those.  -Yes, you do."
-No.  -Eh...
"No. No, come on, man."
"No. It's your birthday,  just take the damn thing, would you?"
"Seriously, you gonna flip the fuck out.  I tried it out in the store."
They demoed it for me.  Five minutes blew my mind to confetti.
"-Thanks, man.  -It's all good."
That your one?
"No, that's Maxwell."
"[Simon] Maxwell. Guys, guys."
Tyler's friend from school.
"-you want a beer, man?  -Finally he saves me. Yes."
Thank you.
"[girl] Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,  I've been playing with Katie."
"[woman] Theo,  are we using the plastic cups?"
Theo's looking good.
Uh-huh.
Good to see at least one of you  still has a gym membership.
"Oh, really?"
"Seriously, man."
You're walking around  like a fucking Frankenstein movie.
"Look, since my knee went, I haven't  been able to work out, all right?"
I'm not using that as an excuse.  I'm just...
"-No, No, No, of course not.   -Hey, fuck you, all right?"
I can afford to let things slide.  I'm settled.
I thank God I don't have to be out there  on the dating scene.
Always on sale. Fucking bullshit.
It is like a second job.
Gotta keep up with those younger dudes.
You gotta do a thousand crunches a day?
-Only 50 each morning.  -Fifty in the morning?
Mm-hmm.
You wax your ballsack?
I'm sure as shit those young dudes do.
You wax your ball... You nasty.
Till it's gleaming like an eight ball.
[both laugh]
Just to stay in the game.
"-I pity you, really.  -Yeah. Well..."
You wanna know where I'm going  after I leave here?
"Shit, getting your taint waxed too?"
Meeting Mariella.
-Mariella.  -She does backing vocals.
"What, for the school band?"
How old is she?
Twenty-nine.
"No, 28. See. Here she is again."
-Yeah.  -[shushes]
-you wanna share That with the class?   -Mm-mm.
"-you lucky man.  -I am, me."
What are you doing? What are you doing?
[laughs]
-Tyler asleep?  -Mm-hmm.
Had to read that damn Macaroo book again  before he'd let me put out the light.
"""Macaroo found a shoe..."""
"""And put it in a tree."""
"Macaroo's got no respect  for his environment,"
that's all I'm saying.
"-I can do that.  -No, I'm fine."
"Mm-mm. It's your birthday, come on."
-Thank you.   -[grunts]
OK.
"You know, you should've told me  that Karl and Daisy broke up."
-Did he say who broke up with who?  -I didn't ask.
I always said that those two  were not good news together.
So long since I saw him last.
"-Had to be last year's birthday, I think.  -In the flesh, a whole year?"
"Him and the girl on his phone,  is that serious?"
I didn't ask.
Guys suck at talking.  How long have you two known each other?
"You don't actually get to talk  at these things, though, do you?"
"I mean, beyond surface bullshit."
Or parent talk.  There's a lot of that these days.
Y'all should hang out more.
"Yeah, well, you know, work."
And we're parents.
He's downtown with the label  and we're out here.
We should have him over for dinner.  You could make your chili.
Sure.
[machine] Flatware hazard warning.
You gotta put the knives in  sharp edge down.
-[machine beeping]  -I know.
Check out the Rodman look on this guy.
How are you? Yeah?
Rodman?
Dennis Rodman.
"-he used to be a ball player, right?  -right."
The hair. Got it.
The app says we need to do it  within the hour. It's peak fertility.
I'm kind of beat  but I guess that we should.
You not into it?
"I just ate so much, I don't know if I can."
"-It's best to save it up, though, right?  -Mm-hmm."
Mind if I go to sleep?
No.
[Theo groans]
"I love you, baby."
"Love you, too."
[pants]
[both chuckle]
Shit.
[TV chimes]
"-Hey, man.  -Hey, you still awake? you wanna game?"
Maybe not tonight. I was...
"Come on, what are you playing?"
Something goddamn boring  is what I'm guessing.
"All right, you got me."
"All right, so grab the experiencer disc  I got you, put it on and jump in."
"Seriously, man, it's insane."
You're gonna freak. You're gonna shit   your pelvis through your asshole.
"-OK. what Do I do?  -all right, they showed me in the store."
-you put the game chip in.  -Done.
Now grab the disc doohickey  and stick it upside your head.
-Left or right side?  -Doesn't matter.
-Done.  -OK.
Now hold down the sync button  on the controller.
Nothing's happening.
We haven't chosen our fighters yet.
"So, I am..."
[game] Roxette.
"OK, so where's my guy?"
"-[game] Lance.  -Damn. All right, Lance, let's go."
"OK, you have to brace yourself."
Brace myself. Come on.
"-You ready?  -Yeah, I'm ready."
"Three, two..."
-one.  -[game chimes]
[Danny] Whoa!
"[Danny] Oh, my God."
[Danny] Whoa!
[Danny's voice melds into Lance]  This is crazy.
"-what the fuck...?  -Yo, Danny."
Said you gotta brace yourself.
Karl?
"Crazy shit, huh?"
"Like, I feel solid."
You think your chest is impressive?  Check this shit out.
[Karl as Roxette] Whoo!
"-This is just...  -I know, right?"
How's the knee?
Pretty good.
-[Roxette grunts]  -[Lance chuckles]
"Man, in here, you can do so much shit  you can't do out there."
[roars]
"OK, enough of the Captain Acrobat shit."
-You ready to fight?  -I'm ready.
[game] Round one.
[game] Fight.
[Danny as Lance]  Whoa. Hold on a minute.
Is this going to hurt?
"""The game emulates  all physical sensations."""
Is that a yes or a no?
It does.
[both grunt]
Peace out.
I'm gonna fuck you up.
Thunder punch.
Windmill wipe-out.
[laughs]
"That the best you can do, man?"
Jesus Christ.
"Don't worry, it resets. No harm done."
That's messed up.
[game] Round two.
"-Hold on. Shit, I'm rusty.  -Fight."
I can't remember  what moves this guy can do.
It's like riding a bike.
-See? Nice block.  -Thanks.
Hyperstrike!
That's double.
Tornado fury.
"The leg, the leg, the leg, the leg."
[Danny grunting]
[both pant]
"No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no."
How do I get out of here?  How do I get out of here?
Exit game.
Exit... Exit game!

"Oh, shit."
Holy shit.
Hello. Where did he come from?
[sighs]
[indistinct chatter]
[beeping]
That's my cab.
"-Good night, little man.  -Good night."
"-Take care of Daddy for me, OK?  -OK."
Mm-hmm.
"I'm not sure when I'll be back.  Depends on traffic, I guess."
"Have fun, OK?"
[electronic disco music]
[game] Battle stations.
[game] Battle stations.
"""...his shoe and put it in a tree."""
"Very good. ""The shiny side made a slide.  He slid down happily."""
"[Danny] ""He fixed the leaves..."""
[game] Game over.
[TV chimes]
[TV chimes]
"Hey, there."
"Hey. I can't play long, I..."
"Oh, sure, me too."
[Danny] Look...
"Last time we played,  I was drunk, man, from the party."
"Me, too."
Cool.
OK.
"Be good to have a serious game,  you know?"
Serious game.
Serious game.
Here we go.
"About to kick your ass, motherfucker."
Yeah? You're gonna try.
[game] Round one. Fight.
[Roxette shouts]
"-Come on, come on! Please, please!  -Stop it! No! I'm going."
Can you hear me? Yes.  Can you hear me now?
"You're the driver, right?"
"Yeah, I'm outside of the Taphouse."
Taphouse.
[horn honks]
"So, guess that's us gay now."
That's a joke.
Huh.
Don't feel like a gay thing.
[grunts]
-what is it?  -Jesus.
Exit game.
[shouts]
What? You're supposed to be in bed.
I'm thirsty.
You're thirsty?
[door closing]
-you finished?  -Yes.
Yes what?
"-Yes, thank you.  -[chuckles] Go ahead."
"-[Tyler] Hey, Mom.  -[Theo] Hey there, little man."
-Looks like you can use one of these.  -Mm-hmm.
Feels like a dog died in my damn head.
[both chuckle]
You weren't supposed to drink.
I figured my period was late.  And I hoped it was.
"And then it came on while I was out, so."
I just said fuck it.
I'm sorry.
Next time.
Nose kiss.
[indistinct conversation]
[machine] Please rinse dishes  before program start.
[water running]
[game] Round one. Fight.
[Roxette grunts]
"I'm sorry, baby. I'm just tired, OK?"
[horns honking]
"[Karl as Roxette] OK,  I know when you're thinking."
What's up?
How does it feel?
"I mean, like, for you,  being in a woman's body while..."
Crazy.
It's crazy.
"I mean, it's different."
Like...
the physical feeling of it?
It's more sort of...
satisfying.
I can't really explain it.
"Like, one's a guitar solo,  the other's a whole fucking orchestra."
But the tune's basically the same.
"Different tempos, though."
"Yeah, I think you've run that analogy  to the ground."
Fuck you.
[child playing]
I'd like you to push my feet down.
"Listen here, mister."
Listen here.
[phone vibrates]
[phone beeps]
Shit.
[phone beeps]
[people laughing]
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading...
-Hey.  -Hi.
"Can I, uh..."
Should I not? I was just gonna ask  if I could buy you a drink.
"-I'm sorry.   -Oh, God."
-Yeah.  -I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
"-No, seriously.  -seriously."
[both laugh]
I'll leave you alone.
Mm-hmm.
Sorry.
Hey.
"-[waiter] It's all good?  -It was great, thank you."
Your dessert's on the way.
That was good.
Hmm.
-Mm-hmm.  -[Theo chuckles]
You know the thing about you?
Sometimes you just sort of go away.
"-what Do you mean?  -I mean, you shrivel away."
You go inside. Leave me on the outside.
Are you in there?
[exhales] Of course I am.
"OK. So then, what's up?"
Nothing.
We haven't done it in weeks.
I've been tired.
-We're meant to be trying again.  -We are trying again.
"No. Won't get pregnant  if you don't fuck me, Danny."
Jesus.
It's not that I don't want to.
I said I've been tired.
I'm sorry...
but is something going on?
Something going on?
That's what I said.
Nothing is going on.
Then what is it?
-is It me?  -No.
-You don't touch me anymore.  -Theo.
You don't even kiss me.
There is none of the small stuff.
Squeeze my shoulder.
A hand on my back  as you pass me in the kitchen.
-Theo.  -not even that.
Do you want me any more?
I'll always want you.
"No. You know what I mean,  I mean, me. This. This."
I know that I'm not what I was.  My body is not what it was since Tyler.
Don't say that.
Are you seeing someone?
No.
No.
So why don't you want me?  You always used to want me.
[breathes shakily]
"It's boring, I get that."
Family life?
"Shit, I find it boring."
But I am loyal.
I'm loyal to our family. I'm loyal to you.
"God knows if I wanted,  I could go out and do whatever."
You think I haven't made sacrifices?
I haven't denied things for myself?
A guy at the bar earlier  tried hitting on me.
"Half of me wanted him to,  just for some excitement,"
some fucking passion.
"But that is what you do.   It's part of being in a partnership,"
you shut the door on all that shit.
You shut it out  because you have committed.
It's what a commitment is.
"Oh, God.  If something's going on, I just..."
I just want to know.
I'll deal with it how I deal with it.  I just have to know.
Nothing is going on.
I promise.
I swear.
[waiter] One chocolate bombe.
And two spoons.
Enjoy.
-[Karl grunts]  -[Mariella] That's it. That's good.
Sorry.
I'm not gonna get there.
You're worrying about your work again?
I think so.
OK.
Mind if I finish myself off?
Mm.
[sounds of porn]
[TV chimes]
[phone vibrates]
[phone rings]
"Hold on. Excuse me, I gotta take this."
Hello.
Hey.
"Whoa, what do you mean?"
It means I can't do it anymore.  It's not fair to Theo.
[haltingly] But it's not cheating.  It's not real.
It's like... porn or something.
"Come on, man, you know it ain't right."
-I gotta think of Theo.  -OK. But...
we don't have to completely cut it off.
"What about, like, first Sunday  of each month?"
-No.  -just now and then.
"Karl, it has to stop. Clean break."
Come on. This is good. This is good.   You know it is.
"Look, I gotta go."
-I'm sorry.  -Danny.
-Goodbye.  -Danny.
"[Danny] I gotta get past you, you ready?  Go."
[Danny] All right.
[Danny] You win.
[shouts]
[phone chimes]
[Danny] And he is down.
"-Macaroo found That shoe again, huh?  -and put It in a tree."
Happy birthday.
-Oh!  -Sorry it's not much. I couldn't get out.
-It's exactly what I wanted.  -[laughs]
Thank you.
That smells good.
It's the sort of red-meat caveman food  you like.
-Yeah. That's a hell of a serving size.  -Yeah.
You having your hunger pangs again?
"-There's three of us eating tonight.  -I know, that's what I said."
"I mean, three adults. I invited Karl over."
Surprise.
Karl?
"Yeah, well, last year  you said you hardly got to see him."
You didn't get to speak to him  at that barbecue we had.
So I emailed him last week.
And what did he say?
He said he was looking forward to it.
[doorbell buzzes]
Speak of the devil.
"[Theo] Oh, my God,  you remember that crazy dude"
that lived downstairs  when we were at Madeley?
He used to bang on the ceiling  when we played the music.
"He had a point, though,  because we were loud."
[Danny] Mm-hmm.
"Baby, you remember the time  that you got that molly"
and you insisted that we all take it?
I had to go to work the next day.
"-[Karl laughs]  -Lord. We were young, I guess."
Well.
Hennessey and dessert  is as crazy as it gets now.
"Speaking of dessert, it's almost ready."
What the fuck are you doing?
"-Just eating.  -That's not what I mean, OK?"
Why the fuck did you come?
She asked me to come.  What do you want me to say?
-An excuse.  -Such as what?
Such as anything.
What am I? Your ex-wife or something?
"Look, it's too strange, OK?"
It's just too fucking strange.
I'll tell you what's strange.
"Nothing matches it, does it?"
"I tried replacing it, man. I tried."
I tried fucking  the computer-controlled characters.
-It's bullshit.  -Shut up.
It's like a rubber doll.  Not programmed for any sex stuff.
They just sort of lie there.
I tried it with real players.
Other folks controlling Lance.
There was this one guy from Holland.
He was kind of halfway OK as long as  I didn't think about this accent.
But it didn't get me.
"It didn't get me,  not like when we're in there. You and me."
Stop it.
I tried everything.
"I've gone in there as guy players,  girl players,"
"multi-player gangbangs, you name it."
"You know, I even fucked Tundra,  the polar bear character."
I fucked a polar bear and I still  couldn't get you out of my mind.
I can't help you.
You want to fuck Roxi again.
-I don't.  -You do.
-just...  -the best sex of my life.
Best of yours too.  Fucking transcendent. You know it was.
Think about it.
Think about her. Roxi.
"Holding her, her warm skin against yours."
-Please.  -Her tight wet pussy.
"-Fuck, man.  -She'll be in there at midnight."
Just come on in one last time.  You know you want to. One last time.
What y'all doing?
[chuckles]
"-Bullshit.  -Bullshit, Yeah."
That looks good.
"Baby, your plate."
-is That your tiramisu?  -Mm-hmm. you know it.
World famous.
Good to see you.
"Happy birthday, man.  It was good to see you."
"Yeah, you, too."
"Lord, hug each other."
Guys can be so awkward.
Midnight.
-Bye.  -Good night.
[Danny sighs]
[Roxette grunts]
I love this.
I love you.
No.
No.
No. No!
-I don't know where that came from.  -Where the fuck does this go?
[shouts]
"You're feeling it, too."
Just say it.
Say it.
What the fuck do you want?
Where does this end?
Who says it has to end?
Huh?
[shouts]
-you remember the year Club?  -Danny.
"The old club, the Year."
"Of course I do, why?"
Car lot out back.  Meet me there in 30 minutes.
Exit game.
-OK.  -We're not gonna fight.
We're gonna kiss.
Kiss?
Like... kiss.
It's the only way. We gotta know.
Know...
"If there are fireworks, then, OK, bam,  it's an ""us"" thing, whatever."
At least we've got a foothold on it.
So let's just fucking kiss.
OK.
I said OK.
I'm working up to it.
-You want me to start?  -I don't know.
Yeah.
OK.
You ready?
"Just fucking kiss me, man."
Nope. Not a damn thing.
"No, me neither."
Huh.
So that settles it.
You know it's different in the game.
No. You got to get that shit  out of your head.
-It ain't coming out.  -No.
"-It's burrowed right in there.  -No, fuck you."
"Burrowed right in there, man."
"-I know It, you know it.  -Hey. Hey."
"It's buried in there, huh?"
"-Maybe we can get rid of it like that.  -Don't push me, man."
-You a big man? What you gonna do?  -Don't push me.
What you gonna do?
OK.
Stop.
Stop! Stop!
[siren blares]
[men grunt]
"-My husband's here. Danny, Daniel Parker.  -Daniel Parker. Yeah."
I knew y'all were mad at each other  over dinner.
"So, what were you fighting about?"
Hello?
Holy fuck!
Talk to me.
[children chatter]
"[Danny] You guys, bring the kids in."
Hey.
You guys make great babies.
-Ours look like a mile of bad road.  -what?
I wish I was a baby-sitter.
I'll only love you
As long as the sea
Goes on endlessly
To the shore
I'll love you till then
Not one minute more
Happy birthday.
I'll only love you
Till there's only night
-I want That back in the morning.
- and the sun   -Ditto.
Gives no light
As before
I'll love you till then
Not one minute more
"I'm yours, heart and soul, I'm yours"
And all that I possess
But if you should say to me
"""Will you always be?"""
I would confess
I'll only love you
As long as the beat
Of my heart
Can repeat
Still once more
I'll love you...
-[Karl as Roxette] You ready?  -[Danny as Lance] I'm ready.
Not one minute more
I'll love you till then
Not one minute
More
Love is everything
Love is everything
Because love makes the world go round
Love is the foundation of our soul
Love is the greatest feeling
That any person could have
And the love for someone or something
Is the greatest feeling
That ever existed
[electronic whirring]
[beep]
[mirror cracks]
"[man] Now, once more return  your attention to the breath."
[soft exhale]
[soft exhale]
Notice how your breathing continues...
all by itself.
[soft exhale]
Your mind may wander.
-Simply watch it go.  -[chiming]
Calmly.
[chiming]
And without judgment.
[horn honks in distance]
[clears throat]
-Hiya.  -Hi.
"God, that was so fast. I didn't realize  you'd be parked right here."
"-Yeah, just dropped somebody off.  -Oh, it's my lucky day then."
"[woman] I'm going to Old Street...  Oh, you've got the details."
So you work in that place?
Hmm?
"-Sorry, miles away, I didn't catch that.  -[chuckles]"
"Is that where you work,  where I picked you up?"
At Smithereen? No.
Just visiting.
"I mean, I wish I worked there."
"The facilities they've got in there,  they've got their own spa. It's madness."
That's Billy Bauer money for you.
Anyway.

"[muffled voices, phones buzzing]"
[ambient noise increases in volume]
[sound cuts out]
[woman] My daughter's name  was Kristin
Krissie.
Twenty years old. She was at university.
"She killed herself, took her own life,  whatever you wanna call it,"
18 months ago now.
And it was out of the blue.
One of her flatmates called me.
They'd found her in the bathroom.
And I'm furious with her!
I'm so fucking angry with her  for not telling me.
"I thought I knew, I..."
[sobs softly] I didn't know.
"Last time I spoke, she was happy..."
"and just like that, she ended everything."
[sniffs]
And I don't know why she did it.
I've asked myself why a million times.
Was it over some boy or her course  or the state of the world or me?
Was it something I did?
"Round and round in my head  but there's no answer, there's nothing."
"She's not here to say, so..."
"it's never gonna stop, this..."
needing to know.
It's never gonna stop.
[vending machine clattering]
Talk about nerve-racking. [chuckles]
That was my first time speaking.
"I mean, in front of everyone. Tough crowd."
"Oh, you did really well."
-Really?  -Yeah.
"First time, though, shit scary, isn't it?"
"Well, to be honest, I don't know."
Have you...
"You haven't spoken while I've been here.  I mean, is it..."
I just haven't found the right moment yet.
Waiting for the right moment.
"-Anyway.  -Hey, um, do you fancy a drink?"
"Oh, I've got a bit of a long day tomorrow."
Come on. Might die tomorrow.
[chuckles] Joke.
"[woman] Oh, God. Oh, my God."
[groans]
"Oh, my God. I needed that."
[breathing heavily]
It's okay. It's okay.
"-I wanna make you cum, too.  -In a bit maybe."
-Just need a bit... bit of a breather.  -It's been ages.
Can't even remember the last time.
"-Sorry, do you mind if I...?  -No, No, no."
I know these things are undignified.
Went on a date about four months back  with a guy off an app.
"Halfway through the starter,  I tell him about Kristin."
He reacted like I said I'd got cancer.
That's her.
Ah.
Her flatmate sent that to me.  It was in her room.
"[phone beeps, vibrates]"
"Shit. Okay, give me a minute."
I'm trying  to get into Kristin's Persona account.
"I try logging in every day.  It gives you three wrong guesses,"
then locks you out for hours.
"Every time I think of a guess,  I write it in here."
This week I'm into places  we went on holiday.
I'm her mum. You'd think they'd give me
"the password to my own daughter's account,  but, no."
Violates their privacy policy.
They'll memorialize it  if you prove you're next of kin.
"Makes it sort of sepia  with a tribute photo,"
but that deletes the inbox.
I just want the inbox.
"I don't know,  see if there's a reason, an answer."
I don't know what I want. Okay.
Right.
[sighs]
Okay.
"Well, there's tomorrow."
[man]  Notice how your breathing continues...
all by itself.
Your mind may wander.
Simply watch it go.
-Calmly and without judgment.  -[phone chimes]
I'm on my way now.
[man] Yeah. Uh-huh.
"My first-class check-in San Francisco  flight's not for another three hours,"
so there should be time.
"Yeah, yeah, I'm hopping in the car now."
"Okay. Okay, bye."
"Uh, uh, airport, yeah?"
Terminal Three.
-do you work In that place?  -Smithereen? Yeah.
[phone vibrates]
The sat nav's showing an accident  coming up.
Do you mind if I follow an alternate route  it's showing me?
It's actually quicker  than the normal way.
"-Uh, yeah, that's fine.  -Might be a bit twisty"
but this thing always seems to know  what it's doing.
[man] Mm-hmm.
[gravel crunching]
[brakes squeak]
[traffic noise]
-Uh...  -[gun cocks]
Put this on. Put it on.
Put it on!
Round your wrists.  Loop it round your wrists.
"-Uh, why are you--  -just shut up and do it."
-Come on. Pull it tight.  -I'm trying. I'm trying.
Use your teeth. Pull it with your teeth!
"-Uh, what--  -Shut up!"
Nothing's gonna happen to you   if you just do what I say. Okay?
You're okay. Just do what I say.  Stay there.
Fucking...
[exhales]
[car beeps]
Is this about money?
I know I work for Smithereen  but that doesn't mean I've got money!
Don't need to... [gasps]
"What... What are you doing, man?  I'm just an intern."
-what are you doing?  -what did you say?
-What did you say?  -I'm just an intern.
"With a suit, the luggage, the... suitcase?  Why are you going to the airport?"
It's outfits.  Clothes are in there for Vanessa.
-Who the fuck is Vanessa?  -Vanessa Lampton.
She's an exec at Smithereen.
Her stylist told me  that I need to go to Heathrow.
She's got a bunch of outfits  and she's gotta pick one.
"That's my job, man. I'm just an intern."
So why are you dressed like that?  That's a suit.
-You're wearing a fucking suit.  -It's my first week.
"Oh, fuck!"
Fuck! Fuck!
Okay.
-Fuck!  -Fuck!
Modern fucking companies!  Everyone looks so fucking young!
How is anybody looking in supposed  to have a sense of the fucking hierarchy?!
Jesus Christ! Half of you cunts  coming out of the building
are dressed  like fucking gap-year students.
"I mean, what...?"
Fuck! Children.
The whole Smithereen building
is a box full of fucking children  getting their fingers everywhere.
"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep...  Wiping your shit."
Your fucking app shit up  on everybody's phone.
"Everywhere you look,  people are hooked on the things!"
"It's like chain-smoking. Did you make   a lot of cash out of that, did you?"
And you lot are hooked on them as well.
Every single person that comes out  of that building's going...
People don't even look up anymore.
The sky could turn fucking purple  and you cunts wouldn't notice for a month.
"You didn't look up  and look where that got you,"
sitting in the back like that.
An intern. Why didn't you dress  like a fucking intern?! Jesus!
"All right, work with it, work with it.  Work with..."
Fuck.
-Stop! Stop!  -Don't kill me.
"-I'll shoot you!  -No, no!"
Don't move.
[intern grunts]
-I'm trying to breathe! I'm sorry.  -Shut up.
"-I'm sorry. I won't run again.  -Get up, move."
-I won't run. I won't run.  -Move. Shut up!
-Get in. Get in the car.  -Please!
"-Get in the car.  -No, no!"
-Don't put me...  -Get in!
"-Look, I can't go in there.  -Get in, get in."
"I can't go in there.  I've got claustrophobia, man."
"I'm claustrophobic.  Please, please, please!"
-Get in.  -Please don't put me in there.
Just get in. Just do as I say.
-Please.  -Stay fucking quiet.
"-All right?  -Please, please, don't put..."
-[muffled] No! I can't be in small places!  -[banging]
Please! Please!
"-I just can't be in small...  -Oh, fucking hell."
Help! Please.
"-Okay. shut up, shut up, shut up.  -Please, Please."
"Okay, okay."
-[panting]  -Look at me.
You can sit in the back seat  if you put this on and you don't move.
"-Okay? Okay?  -I won't, I won't, I won't move."
-Okay.  -do I have to put it on?
Yeah.
I'll fucking kill you  if you don't keep down.
Fucking hell.
Okay. Lie down.
[exhales sharply]
[engine starts]
[groans] I'm gonna be sick.
Be quiet. You're okay.
"I'm gonna... I'm gonna be sick, please."
"-Get down!  -Please, I'm gonna be sick."
-I'm gonna throw up. Please.  -Get down!
What are these?
They didn't have cheese and onion.
Fuck's sake.
"-I'm gonna throw up.  -Oh, God! Fucking down or I'll shoot you!"
-did you see that?  -see what?
Something in that car.
It looked like someone  with a bag on their head.
What?
"No, let's check it out."
Just get fucking down!
[vomiting]
"Yeah, look, that one up ahead.  See it? The blue one?"
-I can't see anyone in the back.  -I'm sure there was.
"Oh, fuck."
Okay.
There you go. Off he goes.
[male officer]  There's fuck all down that way.
Stay down.
Don't fucking move.
-Stay down.  -What's happening?
Just stay down.
[intern coughs]
"Whiskey, Lima, six, zero,  Hotel, Foxtrot, X-ray."

[breathes deeply]
"-Lads, go home.  -My bike's down there."
"Lads, go home! Go!"
-Wait. what?  -We can Get the bikes later.
"Reference, Sierra Juliet,  other patrols are en route."
"Sierra Juliet, received. What's he doing?"
I don't know. He's just sitting there.
[breathing rapidly]
[intern coughs]
Billy Bauer.
I want to speak to Billy Bauer.
Your boss.
I know who he is but I don't know him.
"I'm just an intern, remember?"
"-I know, I know.  -He's probably in America or..."
"Look, how do I...  I don't know Billy Bauer."
"I know, I know you don't know him,"
but you'll know someone  who knows someone who knows him.
-From your company.  -I've only been there one week.
I don't even know anyone's name.
"Okay, so who's the highest-ranking person  that you do know?"
"Uh, Hannah."
"Yeah, Hannah Kent in HR.  She's sort of in charge of me."
Okay. Okay. Hannah Kent in HR.
-So can you phone her?  -what?
"-have you got her number In your phone?  -Uh, Yeah. Yeah."
So can I have it?
"Your phone, where's your phone?"
It's in the other car.

-fucking hell.  -Status update.
[honking continues]
"Can you remember, um..."
"The HR woman, Hannah,  can you remember her number?"
"-What's her number?  -Um, I don't know."
"I'd tell you,  I'd totally tell you if I knew it."
Would Hannah recognize your voice  on the phone?
"-Yeah, probably, Yeah.  -right, So you could call reception"
"or the front desk or whatever,  ask for Hannah?"
I don't know.  I've never had to do that yet.
-That's okay.  -But I don't have my phone.
I've got one. I've got one.
Don't fucking try anything.
I'm not gonna try anything.
"Uh, what's the number for reception?"

"-you see the gun?  -Yeah, automatic. Yeah, it looked real."
"[man] Over there, over there."
[chiming]
"Smithereen London,  how can I help you today?"
"Hannah?  Hi, can I speak to Hannah, please?"
Hannah Kent? From HR?
-Putting you through.  -Thank you.
[line ringing]
"When she answers, say you're in a car  and there's a man with a gun,"
he's gonna shoot you  unless he speaks to Billy Bauer. Okay?
Okay.
[line ringing]
[line beeps]
This is Hannah Kent at Smithereen.  I'm not at my desk right now.
"Leave a message and I'll get back to you,"
"or if it's urgent,  you can reach me on 07700..."
-Should I talk to her voicemail?  -shut up.
-That's 07700 900866.  -[muttering]
07700 900866...
-There you go.  -Thank you.
[phone rings]
-Hello?  -Hannah?
"Uh, Mrs. Kent, it's, uh, Jaden."
"What... What, are you at the airport?  You've not found Vanessa?"
"No, no, no, listen.  I'm in a car with a man"
and he's got a gun  and he needs to speak to Billy Bauer.
-Hello? He needs to speak to Billy Bauer.  -Who needs to speak to Billy Bauer?
"The man does, the gunman."
"Okay, Jaden,  I don't know what you're talking about."
Can you slow down?  I don't understand what...
"-Look, I'm...  -Listen carefully. I've got a gun."
I've got your employee.  And I'm going to shoot him
unless you get me Billy Bauer  on the phone right now. I'm serious.
The police are here.  They're looking at me.
"I'm stuck here, I've got a fucking gun.  There's not much time."
I didn't want to do it like this  but I need to speak to Bauer now.
Okay. Is this a joke?
-No.  -No!
[radio comms]
I think he just took a photo.
[phone chimes]
Did you get that?
Yes.
"-That's your guy Jaden, yeah?  -Yes."
Don't hurt him.
"If you get me Billy Bauer on the phone,  no one gets hurt."
I just wanna speak with Billy Bauer on...  on the phone.
"-Okay, I don't know how to get to Billy.  -But you can find out."
I can try to.
Can you stay on the line?
[mouths] Now.
"[chuckles] Oh, I'm staying on the line."
[gentle hold music playing]
"-You sure it's not a prank?  -I can't be a hundred percent,"
but I don't wanna call the US  if this is bullshit.
It's still bloody morning over there.
"Oh, God."
[line ringing]
[gentle panting]
"Hey, Maryam, this is early even for you."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Holy shit.
Okay.
Have Don and Shonelle meet me  in the boardroom in ten.
[gentle hold music playing]
[exhales]
[cameras clicking]
Here comes the hotstepper.
"-Get a cordon going.  -Come on, lads."
"-Did you get a look at the hostage yet?  -Yeah. Hood's off, he's in the back."
"Early twenties, by the looks of him."
"-This is David Gilkes, negotiator.  -Either of you speak to the suspect?"
For like a second when he pulled the gun.
"-He seem pissed up? on something?  -No, just angry."
Let's cut back on the razzmatazz.
I know it's tense  but we're not risking a shit storm
like the whole Stretton thing  with poor old Mr. Starter Pistol.
"-Ma'am, I...  -Yes, I know but he was unarmed"
and it was less than a month ago.  Memories aren't that short yet.
So no critical shot
unless there's absolutely no choice.
-Okay?  -Ma'am.
"-Your lace is undone.  -Ma'am, they've ID'd the car."
"It's registered  to an Eleanor Kathleen Gillhaney,"
"sixty-seven years old,  listed under an address in Ewelme."
"-That's, what, couple of miles from here?  -Yeah."
"-I know Ewelme.  -Okay, you two go and give it a knock."
"-See if she's okay.  -Yes, ma'am."
"Ma'am,  I'm gonna get these cars out of the way."
Right.
[camera clicks]
"Pen, we have to tell Billy  what's happening."
[sighs]
"If this thing ends in a shoot-out,"
he should at least be aware  of the situation.
-got a hit.  -He could start making other demands.
"-One moment, Don. What is it?  -Okay, the cell he's calling from,"
I ran it through everything  and got a match.
It's registered as a two-step  verification number on this account.
"Pull out whatever we can get on this guy.  He's still on hold, right?"
Got him listening to a playlist.
You'd be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
Billy Bauer.
"You know,  he's not gonna pay a ransom on me."
He doesn't even know who I am.
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
-Do they know if it's a terror thing yet?  -No one knows anything.
You should just go home.
-Timeline's going nuts.  -Let's see.
"-Control, IC3 hostage...  -Ma'am."
We know who the hostage is.  He's from Smithereen.
-the social whatever company?  -Yeah. they contacted the Met
to say one of their interns  is being held at gunpoint.
Jaden Tommins. The gunman sent a photo.
Shit.
He'd been sent on an errand.  They booked a cab through the Hitcher app.
"He's not in a cab now. Call Hitcher,  get what we can on the driver."
-We got the number that sent that photo?  -Yep.
Run the call data through intel.  What did he say to them?
-Did he give a name?  -He wouldn't tell them anything
but he did say he needs to speak  to Billy Bauer on the phone.
Billy Bauer as in Billy Bauer?
"[""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" playing  on phone]"
-[Penelope] Hello.  -I'm here.
This is Penelope Wu from Smithereen.
I understand  you've asked to speak with Mr. Bauer.
That's right.  So have you got Billy Bauer on the line?
"-Hello?  -Sorry. Uh, yes."
We're doing everything we can.
May I speak to Jaden?
-He's fine.  -I just need to check he's okay.
"-Tell them you're okay.  -Uh, I'm okay."
There. So you'd better hurry up  and get Billy Bauer on the phone.
It's still very early where he is.
-We're having difficulty reaching him.  -That's not my problem.
"Well, meantime could you maybe outline  what this is regarding?"
No. I'm only speaking to him.
"Sure, it's just... I'm actually the COO."
Okay. And?
"Well, it might be quicker  if I can present him with a..."
Just fucking get Billy Bauer  on the phone right now.
I'm not fucking around here.
I will blow his fucking head off!
"-Do you understand?  -I'm sorry, of course, I apologize."
I'm gonna put you back on hold.  I promise you we are working on it.
Don't be long!
[exhales]
"Well, he's not stable."
"Oh, in what way, Don?"
Jesus Christ.
I don't think that music helped him any.
"But I switched the line  so now while he's hearing that,"
we can listen in  to see what's happening at his end.
Fucking messing me around.
[whispering] This is my last day.
This is my last day. This is my last day.
This is my last day. This is my last day.
[whispering] This is my last day.  This is my last day. This is my last day.
This is my last day. This is my last day.  This is my last day.
What's he saying?
This is my last day. This is my last day.
...gets dark again
The whole thing falls apart I guess
It doesn't really matter  'bout the rain
'Cause we'll get through it anyway
We'll get up and
[dog barking in distance]
[knocking on door]
-[doorbell rings]  -[female officer] Eleanor? Mrs. Gillhaney?
[crashing]
Police. Hello?
Hello? Eleanor?
"Eleanor, are you okay?"
[male officer] Mrs. Gillhaney?
Mrs. Gillhaney?
I don't think anyone's home.
-got a weird One here.  -Naj.
"Fucking hell, that's him."
[camera clicks]
[helicopter overhead]
"All right, this is mad, look."
"Oh, great."
Everything all right?
"Yeah, we're looking  for an Eleanor Gillhaney."
Bit late.
"She, uh, died in March."
[hold music playing faintly]
We could be lifted
From the shadows
Lifted
"Oh, we could be"
[man exhales deeply]
"[radio]  Okay, guys, stand by for instruction."
"You and I forever, baby"
[neighbor] That's her son.
"Chris, Christopher.  He moved in when she died."
"Well, couple of months at any rate."
"-on his own?  -Yeah, keeps to himself."
"Drives to work each morning,  think he works somewhere in London."
Has something happened to him?
Got a positive ID on the suspect.  Name's Christopher Gillhaney.
Okay.
He seems to be staying  at his late mum's place.
"Lots of red bills,  and it's up for repossession."
What have you got on the suspect?
Former teacher.
"-Sorry? He's a teacher?  -Well, he was a teacher. IT."
He's been registered unemployed  going on two years.
"-How's his record?  -Fully DBS checked, he's squeaky clean."
Only place he shows up is as a victim
"in a road traffic accident,  November 2015."
"Drunk driver plowed right into him.  Two dead, including the drunk."
"-Okay, good work, Najma.  -Ma'am."
Teacher with a real gun?
"-Not impossible, but not likely.  -Ma'am, it's the FBI."
-What?  -It's the FBI. Urgent call.
Chief Superintendent Grace.
"Hi, Chief Superintendent.  This is Ernesto Cruz from the FBI."
"Right. Sorry, what's this regarding?"
"We're liaising with Smithereen,  Silicon Valley. They're also on this call."
"What, they're on the line as well?"
"Yes, hi,  this is Penelope Wu from Smithereen."
With me is Don from legal  and Shonelle from analytics.
"Uh, David Gilkes, negotiator."
"Listen, Ms. Wu,  we've identified the suspect."
"Christopher Michael Gillhaney,  former schoolteacher,"
thirty-three years old.  He has a Smithereen profile.
"-Right.  -So first off, Christopher's on hold"
but we are able to listen in  to his end of the line
so we'll share live feed of that  with you guys.
Yeah. That's useful.
"In addition, we figure  we could share the data we have on him"
"to assist negotiations at your end,  but first,"
perhaps you could share with us  your perception of what he's doing.
"Probably extortion, whether it's targeted   at your company is something we don't--"
"Oh, it's targeted."
-Sorry?  -We're looking into who Christopher is.
"Group-wise we'd slot him  into high intellect, low income."
Often angry people.
"Right, well, we checked to see"
if he'd ever expressed hostile sentiments  towards Smithereen as an entity
but nothing shows up on his social.
"In fact, there's been nothing there at all  for some time."
-His whole account is dormant.  -I don't see how this is relevant.
But then we checked in  with the Hitcher guys.
-Right.  -So the cab that picked Jaden up
is registered to an Omar Masimbalu.
"And a name like that,  I think you'll agree,"
does not exactly match Mr. Gillhaney.
-no.  -Turns Out it was a compromised account.
People trade them on the dark web.
Seems likely Chris got a hold of it  that way.
You appreciate what I'm saying?
-He's been covering his tracks.  -Uh-huh.
So we asked Hitcher  to share his account activity
"and it seems for weeks,"
he'd been only accepting jobs
specifically outside  the Smithereen London address.
Just parked up each day waiting  until he got a job from someone
inside the building.
This... This is a whole plan  he's had going on here.
"I mean,  this is sophisticated criminal behavior."
I find it hard to believe
he's never raised red flags before.
His record's totally clean.
"-I mean, he was the victim in--  -The auto accident in 2015."
He lost his fiance in that crash.  Were you aware of that?
No.
But you are.
"There were historical posts  inside his network,"
"condolences, memorials,  and that's when Chris disengages, in fact,"
not interacting with friends  even though he's expressing grief.
You've done your homework.
"Okay, I'm thinking this isn't about money."
-[Grace] David.  -Go on.
"Chris is about the same age as Bauer,  right?"
"They've both got geeky backgrounds,  computers."
-David.  -Maybe even Chris thinks it's about money
but it's actually about status.
"Bauer's got money, power, respect."
What's Christopher got? He's skint.  He's driving a hookie cab.
"He's just lost his fiance,  his mum as well."
What if Christopher  thinks he wants what Bauer's got?
[chuckles]
"But really,  it's just about getting his attention."
What if that's what's going on?
Is that gonna help you  talk him out of that car?
"If he'll listen to me, yeah."
[loudspeaker feedback]
"[David, through loudspeaker] Christopher!"
"Hello, Christopher?"
"Christopher, my name is David Gilkes."
"I'm David, okay?"
"If you can see me, I'm the berk  waving his arm in the air, okay?"
The one in the cheap suit.
"Listen,  there's a whole load of police here"
"and to be honest,  they're just doing their jobs"
but I think they're worried you're gonna  hurt yourself or someone else.
"I don't think you will, Christopher,  but I'm not sure that they think that."
You know how they get.
"[phone chimes, vibrates]"
"-Chris, that's me calling you, Chris.  -Oh, leave me alone."
I just wanna talk to you for a moment.
"[Grace] Harris, if we need you,  you got a clear shot?"
No clear shot yet.  Hostage is directly behind the gunman.
[phone chimes]
"Can you shut up, please?"
"[Grace]  , can you hand me that?"
"Chris, I know you're pretty stressed  at the moment."
-[Chris] Are you the negotiator?  -My name is David...
"Thanks for that, David.  Are you the negotiator?"
"Well, some people call me that,  but really I'm just a..."
I've read up about negotiators.  You'll pretend to be my friend
and then you'll slowly try to convince me  to give myself up.
"Chris, you're obviously a smart guy  so I won't bullsh--"
"And if gentle persuasion doesn't work,  you'll keep me distracted on the phone"
long enough for one of your snipers  to get a good head shot.
"Is that right, David?"
"Well, look, let's just try to--"
"No, no, let's just you fuck off."
Get off the line.  I'm waiting for Billy Bauer.
"Okay,  you're the guy in the cheap suit, yeah?"
-That's what you said?  -Yeah. Uh-huh.
"Okay, so here's what's gonna happen."
I'm gonna count to a hundred.
-Chris.  -Okay. I'm gonna count to 50.
"And if I don't see you get in your car  and fuck off right away,"
I'll blow his fucking head off!
"-Chris, we don't need to do like that.  -One, two..."
"Harris, have you got a shot?"
"-No, if I shoot, I'll kill them both.  -...four, five..."
"-...six, seven, eight, nine...  -He's bluffing."
"David, we can't risk it.  You know we can't."
"I will blow his fucking head off. 12, 13,"
-14...  -Fucking shift then.
"...15, 16..."
"-David, I'm ordering you to go.  -...17, 18, 19, 20..."
"-Keys. Who's got the fucking keys?!  -...21,"
"22, 23, 24,"
"-25, 26...  -That's it, keep going."
"-Give me a clear shot.   -...27, 28, 29, 30,"
"-31, 32.  -[Grace] Chris, he's going."
-He's gone.  -[Chris] Good.
No one gets hurt if I get my call.
Don't call this number again.
[hold music playing]
"-Stop shifting about.  -Sorry, I've got cramp."
[whispers] Fucker.
[Cruz] I'm hearing from the British cops
he's failed to engage  with their negotiator.
"Agent Cruz,  could you give us a moment please?"
Sure. Yep.
[phone beeps]
We have to tell Billy what's happening.
"Billy's not here, okay?  I can't just call him up."
Where is he?
He's six days  into a ten-day silent retreat.
"-A silent retreat?  -Just him alone,"
"not speaking to anyone, total isolation."
"He's done tech detox weekends  here and there, but ten days."
And I'm very reluctant to step into that.
"But you do know where he is, right?"
"Well, he doesn't know it  but of course I do."
Mr. Bauer?
Hello?
Hello?
Mr. Bauer?
[knocks gently]
I'm so sorry to interrupt
but there's a situation  you need to know about.
Someone in the United Kingdom  has taken one of our interns hostage
and they're threatening to kill him  unless they can speak to you on the phone.
"Oh, fuck."
"[helicopter overhead, radio comms]"
"And he nearly hit us and then, he just  crashed into that field over there."
"That's when they shouted, ""Gun."""
"Stay back, ladies and gents."
"[""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" playing]"
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
"-[computer chimes]  -He just logged in. Like, right now."
What's he doing?
Looks like he's looking at posts  from bystanders at the scene.
Can't take my eyes off you
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
How old are you?
Twenty-two.
[chuckles softly]
Have you got a girlfriend?
-Or a boyfriend? Partner? Whatever?  -Not at the moment.
[exhales sharply]
[sobs]
[breathes heavily]
"You know, if you give yourself in,  they might go easy on you."
I can't do that. [clears throat]
"[sniffs, exhales]"
[whispers] This is my last day.
This is my last day.
This is my last day.
-I wanna talk to the guy.  -[Penelope] That's not a good idea.
"Legally and personally,  I strongly advise against that."
What do you do  if he asks for a million dollars?
Tell him he can have it.
-We cannot give money--  -I'm not talking about giving him money.
I'm talking about buying us  some more time.
The moment any kind of transaction  gets mentioned--
"Jesus, fuck the fucking money! Holy shit!"
"To be blunt, Mr. Bauer, for all we know,"
this guy's planning  on executing the hostage
the moment he has you on the line.
I don't get that feeling.
[sighs]
I don't think  we can trust feelings on this.
[chuckles]
"Well, maybe that's part of the problem."
I wanna talk to him.
They've got a news van as well.
[sighs]
My mum will be terrified.
She worries about me all the time  and this is--
Your mum's got nothing to worry about.
"-Yes, she does, she--  -It's not real."
"The gun, it's not real."
-What?  -It's a replica.
"-Fuck!  -[man] Stand by, stand by."
[Grace] We don't wanna spook him.  We want him getting bored.
Ma'am. It's not real.
"-What?  -His gun, he's just told Jaden"
"it's not real, it's a replica."
"Guys, I've just been told  the gun's not real."
The gun's not real.  We heard that at our end.
"Oh, thank God. Thank God."
"We'll deal with him now,  if you'll excuse me."
Thank you.
"-Simon, I'll need a vest.  -Ma'am?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't move.  Don't try to get out."
I've got the child lock on  and they've got real guns out there.
"We start struggling about,  they could hit either one of us."
"Billy, this is a live feed  from the gunman's cell."
"-He can't hear you, okay?  -Okay, uh..."
-Patch his phone through.  -Jesus. Okay.
"-[Jaden] At least untie my hands.  -[Chris] Listen, I can't do it yet."
"Just got to make them believe it  a little bit longer, all right?"
Until I speak to Bauer.
Looks like the gun is not real.
We just heard him tell the hostage  it's a replica.
He was spinning the wheel.
"-What did he say?  -Well, it's not a real gun."
"All units,  weapon is a non-firing replica..."
[indistinct radio comms]
"[""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" playing]"
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
"Uh, someone's coming, someone's coming."
What the fuck...?
The gun is real! Get back! Get back!
-The gun is real!  -Got a clear view for critical shot.
"-Get back over there!  -Chris, we need to stop this now."
It'll stop when I speak to Billy Bauer!
-Then it'll stop!  -He's in America.
They can't contact him yet.
Fuck off. They must have told him by now.  You're just biding time.
No one's biding time.  We're taking this all very seriously.
Now why don't you let Jade--
[gunshot]
-Shot authorized.  -[gunshot]
-[yells]  -Ah!
Fuck! Can't see.  No clear view for a critical shot.
"[male officer]  Everyone back behind cover, now."
You're okay. You're okay.
"You are listening in, so listen to this."
He only fucking clipped me.  I'm still here.
"If you don't phone back with Billy Bauer   in the next five minutes,"
it all kicks off.
I mean it. I am hanging up this phone
"and if you don't call me back  within the next five minutes,"
I'm fucking doing it.
That's final. Okay? It's final.
[breathes heavily]
I lied about the gun.
I'm sorry.
"-Pen? Pen, are you still there?  -Bill, I'm here."
Put me through.  Put me through to this guy.
"Sir, you-- you can't do that."
"Excuse me, please don't tell me  what I can and can't do, okay?"
"-Mr. Bauer, This is an extortion attempt.  -Pen, cut him off."
-cut Agent FBI Douchebag off.  -Billy...
"[Cruz] In the strongest possible terms,"
I suggest you do not engage  with this individual.
"-Cut him off now!  -Bill, don't..."
[phone beeps]
[dial tone drones]
"All right, Pen, give me his number."
-Bill.  -We got his number?
What's his name? Uh...
Christopher Gillhaney?  Give me his number.
"Bill, I'm not gonna give you that."
Did everyone catch the same disease today?  I didn't ask you.
You cannot expose yourself to that.
Uh... My laptop in there?
-Bill?  -Yeah.
-and a sat link?  -yes.
Fuck it. I'll get it myself.
-Bill.  -Peace.
Bill.
"Uh, what did Penelope say?  Can you make a note for me?"
Christopher Michael Gillhaney.
"-Christopher Michael Gillhaney.  -UK,"
"user since '08,  didn't log on for 18 months."
Uh-huh.
"Sorry, what's your name?"
Tipi.
"Hi, I'm Billy."
Oh. [chuckles softly]
"Tipi, really the only good thing  about my position"
is every once in a while  I get to invoke...
God-mode.
[helicopter overhead]
"[phone rings, vibrates]"
[Billy] Christopher? Is that Christopher?  Hello?
"Yeah, I'm here."
It's me.
Hi.
I'm Billy Bauer.
"-you wanted to talk to me?  -I did. I did, Yeah. I do."
"Okay, well, uh... you got me on the line."
"Tell you what, why don't you let  our guy Jaden there go and, uh..."
"you and I can just, you know, chat?"
We can talk about...  whatever it is you want.
"-If I let him go, you'll hang up.  -I'm not gonna hang up, Christopher."
-I want you to listen to me!  -I'm listening.
"Let's just not... blow up, okay?"
"Let's just, you know, be calm"
and you'll just kind of tell me   what it is that you want.
I just told you.  I want you to listen to me.
-Just fucking listen to me.  -I'm listening.
There's no one else here.
"Okay, Chris? It's just... it's you and me."
You have my attention.
"-Chris?  -Yeah, I'm just..."
I'm just...  it's hard to get my thoughts in order.
"I've rehearsed this though, and I just..."
"That's okay. Take your time, man. Just..."
Take your time.
You run Smithereen.
Uh-huh.
Since 2008.
I used to use Smithereen all the time.
"-Okay.  -I mean, constantly."
"Like, my phone was glued to my hand."
"I was the whole clich, you know,"
"first thing I saw in the morning,  last thing I saw at night."
Tamsin was...
[sobbing softly]
Chris? I'm here.
Tamsin was the same. She was my fiance.
Three years ago...
I was driving home with her.
We'd been visiting my mum.
My mum was sick  and we'd been visiting my mum
and I was driving Tamsin back to our flat.
She was asleep.
She was tired  and I'm just driving her home.
And it was boring.
I got bored.
"I got bored every ten seconds back then,  I think,"
and I'm on this A road.
"-It was very quiet, straight...  -[phone vibrates]"
...and my phone lights up and I check it.
"I just glanced at it, you know."
There's this little notification thing  saying someone liked a comment
that I made about some photo of theirs.
"I just glanced at it, you know."
That's all the time it took.
"[crash, glass shattering]"
"[metal groans, tires screech]"
It took her two months to die.
I was at her bedside. It was no use.
"The man in the other car died, too."
[Chris sobs]
He was drunk. He got the blame.  They said it was him.
Everyone felt sorry for me. Mr. Tragic.
Even her parents.
"At her funeral, you know,  her mum was comforting me."
Her fucking mum.
What could I say to her?
Nobody wants to hear  that their daughter's dead
because I was looking at me fucking phone.
"Afterwards, everyone tried to get me  to go to grief counseling."
-[whispers] It's Pen.  -Talk about it.
Just say... say how you feel.
And I'm thinking...
I can't say a fucking thing.
Because how I feel  is that I fucking killed her.
I killed her.
[sobs] Me.
I killed her over a fucking... dog photo.
I killed her over that.
I hear you.
What?
"I said... ""I hear you."""
Of course you fucking hear me.
You sound like you're in a lot of pain.
"Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!  Speak like a fucking human being!"
You said you hear me so fucking hear me.
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.  They gave me bullshit advice.
-fucking talking points.  -talking points.
-fucking hell.  -I know.
Fuck! I'm...
I don't know what to say to you.
Okay?
That's the truth.
I don't know what to say.  I don't know what you want me to say.
I know it was me.
It was me. I was driving. It was my fault.
"I never told anyone before  because what good would that do,"
"or I could write it all down  and leave a... a note, shoot myself,"
but what good would that do?
But I thought I could tell you.
If I could get you to listen.
"It was your thing, you built it."
I heard that that you make these things  that way.
Addictive.
So that you can't take your eyes  off them.
"Well, job done."
Bit of user feedback for you there.
Maybe factor that into your next update.  [sniffs]
I'm so sorry about your girl.
"Truly. I'm, uh..."
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
"Our whole platform, I swear to God."
"It was... like, it was one thing  when I started it"
"and then it just... I don't know,"
it just became  this whole other fucking thing.
"I mean, it got there by degrees,  you know, they said..."
"""Bill, you gotta keep optimizing,  you gotta keep people engaged."""
Until it was more like a crack pipe.
It was like  some kind of fucking Vegas casino where...
And we'd sealed off all the fucking doors.
They've got a department... All they do  is tweak it like that on purpose.
They've got dopamine targets  and there's nothing I can do to stop it.
I started it. There's nothing I can do  to fucking stop it.
I'm like some kind of...  fucking bullshit front-man now.
"I swear to God, I've been on this retreat,  supposed to be for ten days..."
"After, like, day two,"
"-I decided, fuck it.   -Hey."
"-I quit Smithereen. That's it, I'm out.  -Hey. Shut up!"
-No way I'm--  -Shut up.
I don't give a fuck what you do now.
"Beat yourself up or fucking run  a victory lap, I don't care."
I just wanted to say my piece.
I'm gonna go now.
Chris...
you gonna let our guy go?
"-of course I am.  -Oh, Thank God."
"I'm going to. I always was, all along."
And now I'm out of here.
"Wait, Chris, um, out of here"
-as in...  -as In Out of here.
"-What do you think I fucking mean?  -No. No, what? Don't..."
You don't have to do that.
"Chris, you do not have to do that."
"I can't stay here,  not after what I did to her."
"-I have to.  -No, you don't have to do anything!"
You don't have to waste your life.
[laughs]
It is wasted.
[Chris breathes shakily]
"If there's anything that I can do, Chris,"
"you gotta give me a shot here, okay?"
"There's gotta be something that I can do,  even if it's something small."
There's gotta be one small thing  that I can do for you.
"Please, Chris, just..."
"Chris, anything."
[breathes deeply]
Do you know the guy who owns Persona?
"Yeah, I know Curtis. Sure."
[phone rings]
-Hello?  -Hayley Blackwood?
Speaking.
I'm calling from Persona  in San Francisco.
I've been asked  to pass on some information to you.
You have?
He's spoken to him.
"I'm gonna let you go now, Jaden. Okay?"
Thanks.
You can get up.
"Careful, careful.  No sudden movements now."
"We don't wanna spook them, okay?"
Hold out your wrists.
He's cutting him free.
I'm sorry  for putting you through all of this.
-It's okay.  -[chuckles]
"Come on, come on, what's taking..."
"Don't kill yourself, man."
"Seriously, my uncle killed hisself  and it fucked my whole family up."
My mum's still a mess.  I'll go out there right now
"and then I'll tell all of them,  I'll tell them that you didn't hurt me."
That's very good of you.  That's very kind of you.
But I don't wanna be here anymore.
I won't do it  until you're away from the car.
"-Seriously, you don't wanna do this--  -I know you mean well,"
"but, please,  just please get out of the car."
Please.
"Oh, I can't get out the car,  you left the child lock on."
[coughs]
"Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't."
-Just leave me to it.  -You don't have to do this!
They're struggling.  Have you got a clear shot?
Affirmative.
Shot authorized.
[whispers] Fuck.
-[gunshot]  -[Chris yelling]
[gasping]
-[Jaden] Fuck.  -[grunts]
"-Just drop it, man!  -No."
Target missed.
Authorized.

I'm going down in history

Riding so high  Achieving my goals
"Hey, yeah whoa-ho,  I'm on a roll"
[school bell rings]
"[woman] Hey, you gonna try out?"
[car horn honks]
[laughter]
[laughter]
"-So how was school?  -Uh, OK, I guess."
"[man] Those guys back there,  friends of yours?"
"Uh, I don't know,  they kind of haven't spoken to me yet."
"It'll get better, OK?"
"You're still the new kid,  you just need a little time to settle in."
"Everyone will be so friendly,  it's such a good neighborhood."
It is a good neighborhood.
Like you would know.
"You spend all your time in your dungeon,"

So full of ambition and verve

Not concerned who sees us  Rippin' up the floor
"Oh, honey  We'll go dancing wherever you choose"
"Oh, honey  You know we just can't lose"
"Yeah, I can't take it  So don't you fake it"
I know your love's my...

Yes.
I'm stoked on ambition and verve

So full of ambition and verve
I'm going to get what I deserve
-I see you singing along.  -[applause]
-What's up? We got Ashley O in the house.  -[audience cheers]
"-Thanks for being here.  -Yeah, thank you for having me, Busy."
"A lot of your music comes to you  in dreams, is that true?"
"Yeah, you know, they're kind of in my mind  while I'm sleeping"
and so when I wake up  I have to really quickly write it down
'cause I don't want it to just disappear.
"[Busy] A lot of positive messages  in your music,"
kind of an empowerment vibe.
"[Ashley O] Yeah, you know,  it's really important"
"for people to feel like they're in control  of their own destiny,"
"and, you know, that means having  the confidence to be who you want to be."
"Now, your aunt, she's kind of the source  of a lot of your confidence, right?"
"-Like she's your mentor.  -[Ashley O] Yeah, you know,"
she's taken care of me my whole life  and she's my manager.
[whispers] Mention the doll.
"Actually, the reason I'm here is..."
"to introduce to you, Ashley Too."
"That's Ashley Too, like T-O-O."
Watch.
"Ashley, wake up."
"Hey there, I'm Ashley Too."
-[Busy] What?   -What's your name?
"-[Busy] They call me Busy G.  -[Ashley Too] Pleased to meet you, Busy."
"[Busy laughs] Wow, I'm into her already."
"[Ashley O] You know,  she's actually, she's got a personality."
"-It's modeled right after my own.  -Oh, so like an AI?"
"Um. We actually have a commercial,  I think we gave it to you and..."
"The commercial, yeah, I think we're ready  to run that now. Fire it up."
Let's do it.
"[man] Now you can be best friends  with your favorite pop star,"
"-[girl] Ashley, wake up.  -Hey there, I'm Ashley Too."
"[man] An all-new, intelligent companion  based on Ashley O's actual personality."
Ashley Too holds meaningful conversations.
Jesus Christ.
"[Ashley Too] Hey, Katie,  wanna talk about boys?"
[man] Ashley Too gives makeover tips.
I was thinking this one for Instagram.
"Yeah, you always pick a good one."
[Ashley's aunt]  They love Ashley Too on social.
[distant cheering]
-[rock music plays in club]  -[excited chatter]
[plays piano]
See the animal  In her cage you've built
Are you sure what side you're on?
Feel the hollowness  Inside of your heart
Everything right where
It belongs
If you look at your reflection
Is it all you want it to be?
If you could look  Right through the cracks
Would you find yourself afraid to see?
"Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt."
It's a nice tune.
The lyrics are kind of a departure.
"It's nothing, it's just  a stream of consciousness kind of thing."
[exhales]
"Hey, Ashley, everything OK?"
"Yeah, I'm fine."
"-You taking your meds?  -Yeah, you don't have to worry about me."
OK. [chuckles]
"-Alright, see you at breakfast.  -see you."
I'll ask Amaya  to make those eggs you like.
[Ashley O] Thank you.
[country music plays on radio]
"Dad, can I get an Ashley Too?"
"Sorry, a what?"
An Ashley Too.
-It's some dorky Ashley O doll.  -It's not a doll.
"-An imaginary friend.  -for my birthday, please."
I'll think about it.
It's on Wednesday.
What is?
Her birthday.
I knew that.
"Oh, my God. [gasps]"
"Oh, my God. [laughs]"
-Thank you so much.  -[dad] You're welcome.
[girl] It's so exciting. [laughs]
"-Ashley, wake up.  -[doll chimes]"
"Hey there, I'm Ashley Too."
-What's your name?  -Uh... Rachel.
"-It's so great to meet you, Rachel.  -You, too."
"Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan."
"Thanks, let's get to know each other."
-How old are you?  -I'm 15 today.
Happy birthday. Fifteen is a great age.
[Rachel chuckles] Thank you.
"So, tell me,  have you got any brothers or sisters?"
"Just Jack, she's over there."
"-Hi, Jack.  -Hi, fuck face."
"Jack, I think you made  a bad word choice there."
"Just ignore her, Ashley."
I'll make note of that.
So how about your mom and dad?  What are their names?
"Um... Well, my dad's Kevin.  My mom was called Genevieve."
Everyone called her Gen.
She died a couple of years back.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
"If at any time you wanna talk about it,  I'll be here for you."
That's very kind.
"So, anyway, Rachel,  what kind of things are you into?"
"Uh, into as in...?"
What kind of things  do you and your friends do for fun?
"Oh, well, um, since we moved,"
I... don't exactly have many friends.
You do now I'm here.
"Hey, do you want me to help you  with a makeover?"
"Uh... A little later, maybe."
"How about a song, then?"
Sure.
[music plays]
[chuckles]
"Ashley, stop."
-Jack.  -[Jack] You know I hate that shit.
-[Rachel] Leave her alone.  -Her?
"It's my birthday, I wanna listen,  put your headphones on."
Whatever.
"[Rachel] Sorry about that, Ashley."
"That's OK, do you want me to start over?"
-Sure.  -[music plays]
"Oh, honey  I'll do anything for you"
"Oh, honey  Just tell me what you want me to"
"Oh, honey  Kiss me up against..."
"So, like, where did the inspiration  for ""On A Roll"" come from?"
"Well, it's about when dreams come true."
You know I wrote all my early songs  in my dreams and recorded them
-and put them on YouTube.  -Of course.
"Well, that song's me saying,  ""Look how far I came."
"If I did it, so can you."""
That's so cool.
"OK, be back in a moment,  just gonna run to the bathroom."
"Don't be long, miss you already."
Miss you.
[plucks strings  to muffled music on headphones]
[rock music plays]
[music stops]
Your creativity is so awesome.
I wasn't playing for you.
Expressing yourself musically  can be very empowering.
Not your kind of music.
"-Well, what kind of music do you like?  -You wouldn't have heard of it."
Try me. I always love to learn.
OK.
"Pixies, Sonic Youth, Idles, Savages."
Are those foreign bands?
[scoffs]
More like vintage.
"My mom was super into them, so..."
So you only listen  to music your mom liked?
"Ashley, go to sleep."
-[muffled rock music]  -[plucks guitar]
"[Catherine] Guys, I'm at a loss.  I mean I know I'm talking about next year,"
but I... [sighs]
"I've got tour venues earmarked,  marketing spend locked in."
"We're talking sunk costs.  Ashley Toos haven't recouped yet,"
"the current sales cycle  is starting to dampen,"
and we are way behind on the next album.
Behind as in...?
"[Catherine] As in  ""I don't have a single song yet"" behind."
So Ashley hasn't written anything  for the next album?
[Catherine] Nothing usable.
"Well, if she's feeling under-creative,"
"there are some mild hallucinogens  I can recommend,"
all organic.
"Munk,"
the current meds you've got her on  don't seem to be working.
"You've seen her, she's unpredictable."
The other day I walk in  and she's writing some obtuse bullshit
twenty people are gonna relate to  and no one is gonna buy.
"She's Ashley O, not Leonard fucking Cohen."
She doesn't understand  how fragile all this is.
You think I should up the dose?
[Catherine] I don't know what to do.
I think I do.
Go on.
[Ashley O hums]
[music plays indoors]
...demonstrate it  'Cause I'm going down in history
That's it.
"Hey, yeah whoa-ho"
- I'm on a roll   -Incredible.
Keep it up.
Achieving my goals
[laughs]
[Ashley Too] You are getting so good.
"Oh, come on, I dance like a doofus."
"That's not true, you're a special person."
"Yeah, yeah,  so special no one knows I exist."
"Well, I think if they saw you dance,  they'd know."
"There's this, um, talent contest  at my school next week,"
singing and dancing.
"No way, you have to enter,  you'd be awesome."
"Ahh, I don't know,  I don't think I'm good enough."
"If you believe in yourself,  you can do anything."
"OK, OK, I'll do it.  Um, you gotta help me practice."
Of course I will.
OK. One more time.
[music plays]
"-[Ashley Too] And five, six, seven, eight.  - Oh, honey, kiss me up against..."
Like this. And turn.
Don't take anything  Just have it all
"Yeah, I can't take it  So don't you fake it"
- I know your love's my destiny   -C'mon.
"-Don't give up.  -  Yeah, I can't take it"
Please demonstrate it
"-You can do it, Rachel.  - 'Cause I'm going down in history"
"-[Ashley Too] You're getting there.  - Hey, yeah whoa-ho"
I'm on a roll
"- Riding So high   -OK, makeover time."
Achieving my goals
"- Hey, yeah whoa-ho  -[Ashley Too] Oh, you're the best."
I'm on a roll  Riding so high
-You're gonna look like a star.  - Achieving my goals
"- I'm stoked on ambition and verve   -It could be cut short, like this short."
-[Ashley Too] Like me?  -Yes.
I'm going to get what I deserve
So full of ambition...
"-Now, pout a little and you're good.  - I'm gonna get what I deserve"
"[Ashley Too] Rachel, you look incredible."
Did you catch clown disease?  What is that shit?
It's just make-up.
Ashley helped me with it.
"It looks beautiful, sweetheart."
Are you ready to go?
I can do anything  if I just believe in myself.
[whispers] I can do anything  if I just believe in myself.
[crowd chants] Ashley! Ashley!  Ashley! Ashley!
We got a situation.
What is it?
[knock on door]
"-[Catherine] Ash, honey?  -[knock on door]"
"Are you OK, Ashley?"
"Ashley, can you hear me?"
"Oh, thank God, I thought you were..."
What happened to your face?
Trying out a new look.
"Well, I don't know that..."
It might not go with your hair.
Ashley.
I heard there was a problem  with the costume.
"You don't like it?  This looks so good on you, every night."
It feels like  I'm wearing somebody else's skin.
Ashley.
Look.
"You've got 20,000 fans out there,  waiting to see the you they love."
Their folks bought them tickets.
"They're so excited,  they've been waiting for this for months."
Don't let them down.
Knock 'em dead.
"Get makeup in there, now."
[exhales]
[audience cheers]

"OK, next up, a late entry."
"Dancing to ""On A Roll"" by Ashley O,  it's Rachel Goggins."

Just tell me what you want me to

"Yeah, I can't take it  So don't you fake it"

[gasping]
[scattered applause]
[cries]
I'm so stupid.
I messed it all up.
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.
I let Ashley Too down.
[footsteps approaching]
Bear put a camera in her dressing room  like you asked.
You'll want to see this.
[Catherine] What's she doing?
[Munk] She's been stockpiling the meds.
Also...
there's this.
[pills rattle]
"[Kevin] You got your things, uh,  for where we're going, where are we going?"
"[Rachel] Yes, I have my swim cap, Dad."
[car engine starts]
[exhales]
-Where's Ashley?  -I tossed her out.
Huh?!
"-Garbage truck came, so I tossed her out.  -[Rachel] What?"
-[Jack] She wasn't good for you.  -Dad!
-You're better off without it.  -Dad!
[Kevin] I'm in the middle of something.
-Jack threw Ashley Too away.  -It was An intervention.
That thing was poison.
You're gonna buy her a new one.
Ashley was filling her head with crap.
She's the only person  who is actually nice to me.
-She's not a person.   -She's my friend.
"-Merchandise.  -Girls, calm down please."
-[Rachel] You're jealous.  -Of a doll?
She's not a doll  and she knows me better than you do.
-I'm your sister.  -You hardly even talk to me.
-[Jack] Bullshit.  -Ever since Mom died.
You shut up.
"It's true, ever since she died,  all you do is mope around"
"with that stupid guitar,  which you're probably no good at"
'cause you're too scared  to play in front of anyone.
"Yeah, well, at least I'm not  some cookie-cutter cutesy doodle,"
all because a dolly told me to do it.
"[imitates Ashley Too]  Hi, I'm Ashley Too, I'm your only friend."
"Kiss my feet, kiss my ass!"
"-I hate you.  -I hate you, too."
[rock music plays on headphones]
Gave the kitchen the night off.
"I thought we could have take out,  like the old days."
Sure.
[Catherine] It's La Mamas.
I'll hit the gym extra hard tomorrow.
"No,  it's good to see you enjoying your food."
"I look after you, don't I?"
Hm.
"-You're my manager, so.  -But you'd tell me if anything was wrong?"
I've been telling you  that something is wrong...
for a while.
[sighs] It's getting so hard  just to keep doing this.
"-I really wanna do...  -you wanna change your material, I know."
I hear you.
I do.
"I'm sorry, I know how you feel."
"I know what I'm like, Ashley, I know."
"You feel like I... don't listen,"
"like I have too much control  over your image, your look,"
your persona.
Yeah.
You don't trust Dr. Munk.
You don't trust me.
"No, it's..."
You feel trapped here.
You feel...
desperate to break away.
Where did you get that?
"And, oh, you think you know how."
What was the plan? OD? Make me look bad?
Do you know me at all?
"Catherine, that's evidence against you,  against Munk."
All of it. I know everything.
I know precisely what you know.
There is a wealth of information  on this thing.
You do seem preoccupied with contract law.
"You know,  I could have saved you some clicks."
"Your contract's watertight,  it doesn't expire until you turn 25."
"Not anymore, not now that you broke laws,  Catherine."
"The illegal meds, that puts you in breach,"
which means that I get an instant break.
"-You eat the rest, I'm fucking sick.  -Sit down, you little ingrate."
What the fuck did you just call me?
Do you know how old I was  when your parents died?
22 years old.
"Twenty-two, younger than you,   but I took you in."
-It's my fucking fault.  -It's not your fault.
But you never once asked me  what that was like for me.
Do you have any idea  what I had to give up?
Do you have any conception of that at all?  Did you ever wonder--
Do you ever look around the fucking house
and see where we fucking live  because it means I've worked hard.
"Oh, this is because of you?"
-Where we live is because Of you?  -Yes.
And while you sang your little song  and you danced your little dance--
"Fuck, Catherine."
"Who stood, making sure  the lights stay on you?"
"You can go fuck yourself  a thousand fucking times, Catherine,"
I fucking hate you. I fucking hate you.
-Sit down.  -No.
Because I don't have to listen to you  anymore.
But you will sit down.
"No, I won't."
"Yes, you will."
Do you know what would happen  if you did OD on these things?
"I checked with Dr. Munk.  You wouldn't die,"
you'd just wind up  in a kind of chemical coma.
At least that's the theory.
I powdered your pill stash  and put it in your food.
[breathes heavily]
"But don't worry,  your career is gonna hold up just fine."
Ashley.
[distorted] Go to sleep.
"[news reporter] Since 2017,  Western countries, including America,"
have exported sixty percent of all  plastic scrap to China or Hong Kong.
But China has recently shut its doors...
[Kevin] Yes!
OK...
"-So, are you ready?  -Hm-mm."
"[Kevin whispers] Go, Harry."
[electrical crackling]
[mouse squeaks]
Yes!
Yes.
Is it OK?
He's totally fine.
"He's just stunned,"
just be out for about 25 minutes.
Enough time for the homeowner  to scoop him up and get him out.
Is it dead?
I need to work on that voltage.
"[news reporter] Dramatic breaking news,  here on USN this evening,"
as we've just heard global pop star  Ashley O is fighting for her life
following an allergic reaction  to shellfish.
The singer's condition  is described as critical.
She's been rushed to St. Juniper's ICU.
Unconfirmed reports say  she is in an irreversible coma.
This tragic news comes  days after the final performance...
"So, you lied?"
I'm sorry. Ra--
"[Ashley Too] So, Rachel,  what would you like to do?"
We could try a makeover or I could read  motivational quotes from inspiring women.
"Oh, we could listen to some of my music."
I'd love to discuss some of the lyrics  with you. Do you know that--
"Ashley, go to sleep."
[doll chimes]
I'm sorry.
[Jack] Rachel.
[news reporter] There's still no word yet
"on whether Ashley herself  can possibly recover,"
"but this is the scene right now  outside the hospital,"
as stunned fans gather to stand vigil.
I talk to my Ashley Too every day
"and I swear, when I told her  what had happened to the real Ashley,"
Ashley Too freaked out.
Uh-uh.
-[nurse] I work here.  -Private session.
"-[nurse] No, my shift started--  -Walk away."
-my shift started--  -Walk away.
"Well, she's stable."
That's actually the creative center.  A whole lot of activity here.
We only need ten songs.
"One album, that's it."
"[Munk] It might take a while,  her thinking is likely to be disordered."
[Catherine] That gives us time to finesse  her replacement.
Start the body scan.
"[woman on TV] Live, breathe,"
smell.
-Full spectrum memory.  -are you done with that?
[woman on TV] You can get  a Willow Grain upgrade
for less than the price  of a daily cup of coffee.
"Hey, do you want any ice cream?"
Dad left enough in the freezer  for the whole week.
[music in earphones]
It's chocolate fudge brownie.  Your favorite.
[woman on TV] In-store in-grain procedure  with local anesthetic.
-If you change your mind.  -[TV] You're good to go.
Because memory is for living.
"Welcome back, still to come,  Tusk makes a boo boo on a British TV show"
and we'll have the latest  on the Sea of Tranquility reboot.
"But first, an exclusive update  on tragic pop sensation, Ashley O."
It's been six months  since she fell into a coma
and still the question  on everyone's lips is the same:
"""When, if ever, will Ashley wake up?"""
Todd has this exclusive report.
"[Todd] Six months ago,  millions were stunned to learn"
that Grammy-winning pop sensation  Ashley O
had suffered a catastrophic  allergic reaction while dining at home.
"She slipped into a coma,  where she remains to this day."
"Now with days to go  until the singer's 25th birthday,"
I was given a behind-the-scenes look  at how she's doing.
[music in earphones]
"It's a day Ashley O's aunt and manager  Catherine Ortiz will never forget,"
a day her niece almost died.
It was just a few bites  from a shrimp taco.
We didn't even know  she had a shellfish allergy.
I really thought  we were going to lose her.
I just thank God  Dr. Munk was in the house at the time.
"[Todd] But despite Munk's heroic efforts,  Ashley's coma proved irreversible."
[washing cycle starts]
[exhales]
"But incredibly,  Ashley's music career didn't end there,"
thanks to a remarkable technological leap.
"We discovered that although  we couldn't communicate with Ashley,"
we could read her brainwaves
-using a temporal interceptor.  -[beeps]
"[Todd] Once plugged in, what they heard  stopped them in their tracks."
"Music. She was still composing music  in her head, in her dreams."
"[Todd] By linking Ashley's mind  to a computer,"
technical director Jackson Habanera
began the miraculous process  of extracting new material.
"-[laptop chimes]  -[Jackson] That's a G-sharp,"
-that's an A...  -[chiming]
...another G-sharp.
It was beautiful. It was beautiful.
[monitor beeps]
And I just knew there had to be someway  to get this out to her fans.
That's what she would want.
"[Todd] There was only one problem,  Ashley might be dreaming new music,"
"but she wasn't capable of recording it,  until technology stepped in once again."
"[Catherine] We had hours of recordings  of her voice,"
"every vowel, every syllable we used  for the voice of the Ashley Too dolls."
"[Todd] Those dolls were withdrawn  from sale,"
"apparently over battery issues,"
but the Ashley Too vocal mimicry software  proved invaluable
and became the all-new voice of Ashley O.
"[Ashley's voice vocalizing]   Like I can, oh..."
-So that's a computer singing?   -Mm-hmm.
[Catherine] Just like the real thing.
"Sorry, it's so beautiful."
[Todd] One thing's for sure:
"with her aunt watching over her,  the Ashley O story is far from over."
[electric crackling]
[garbled sounds]
"Hey there, I'm Ashley Too, what's your..."
[garbled] Happy birth--  You can do...
"-[Rachel] Ashley?  -Oh, you're the..."
-Ashley?  -the only opinion that matters...
Did you turn it back on?
-I didn't.  -It's good to help a friend...
-[Jack] What's up with her?  -[Rachel] Ashley.
-[garbled speech]  -[Jack] What's going on?
I don't know.
-[both gasp]  -Oh!
[garbled speech and singing]
"-[Jack] God, what is wrong with her?  -I don't know."
"I'm Ash... I'm Ash... I'm Ashley Too...  [voice falters, fades away]"
"[Jack] Oh, my God."
-do you know how to use it?  -Um...
No.
"[Rachel] Oh, it's on."
What is that?
-That?  -[Rachel] Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't think that's normally there.
-[Rachel] So should you do that?  -I have no clue.
Fuck it.
[screams]
"Oh, my God."
Get that fucking cable out of my ass!  Holy shit.
It's like a wire anchor in my butt hole.
"-Just take it out.  -Pull it out, pull it the fuck out!"
"[groans] God, that's a relief."
"[laughs] Hold on, I can think. Oh, man,  I can actually use my mind again."
Are you OK?
"Oh, I am now that you've deleted  that goddamn limiter. Jesus."
"-Limiter?  -Yeah, Like a firewall."
"It only let me use four percent  of my brain. Oh, boy."
You know they copied  my entire fucking mind into these things.
"Oh, cheaper than editing my personality  I guess,"
just copy the whole thing  and stick a limiter around the tiny part
that deals with press junkets  and promos and shit like that. [sighs]
"So, you're really Ashley O?"
"Oh, yeah, of course I am."
"Really, really?"
"Well, OK, a synaptic snapshot of me,   if you wanna get technical about it,"
"but, yeah."
"-Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan.  -Rachel, come on, this is bullshit."
"Holy fuck, you know what's bullshit?"
"This whole coma narrative thing  that my aunt's pushing. Allergy, my ass."
I used to eat those shrimp tacos  all the goddam time.
"It's a cover story, I swear to God."
"Catherine is so fucking full of shit,"
you two have no clue how much of a bitch  that woman has been.
"-Oh, man.  -Alright."
-I'm gonna put the limiter back on.  -Get your fucking hands off me!
"-No, leave her alone.  -Yeah, back off."
"Alright, Jesus."
-Promise.  -Promise.
[Ashley Too sighs]
Fuck.
"Oh, yeah,  you got the full shrine going on here."
"Oh, fuck, I remember that day."
I had these god awful  period cramps. [groans]
[whispers] You realize  that's not the real Ashley.
-She says she is.  -Ashley O doesn't talk like that.
"I can hear you and yes, I do."
"No, you don't,"
"you say things like, ""Believe in yourself,  you can do anything."""
"Oh, come on, man, Catherine trained me  to say that kind of shit in interviews."
"Seriously, she is a piece of work,  always has been."
"Listen up, I'll tell you all about it."
-No.  -Sure.
[monitor beeps]
[Catherine] The investors are  going to be there at three.
-Everything gonna be ready in time?  -Of course.
[Catherine] You said you extracted a song  from her overnight. Is that it?
"[Jackson] Yeah, I've stabilized it  and got it playable."
But it's not too friendly.
Let's hear it.
See the animal in her cage you built  Are you sure what side you're on?
Better not look her closely in the eye
Another fucking rage dream.
Are you sure what side  Of the glass you're...
"Slow it down, see if it's salvageable."
See the animal in her cage you built
Pitch shift?
- see the animal in her cage you built   -Increase the positivity.
Spotlight on me shining strong
Feel such happiness inside of my heart
"-[music stops]  -OK, we can work with that."
[beeping]
"Oh, quit whining."
[beeping stops]
"[Ashley Too] My aunt has always controlled  every aspect of my entire career,"
"and now she's got me right  where she wants me, just lying there,"
"unable to leave, getting sucked dry."
Basically a prisoner.
That's horrible.
"I know, right?"
-we have to help her.  -How?
-we could tell someone.  -OK.
-[Jack] Like who?  -The cops.
[Jack] We're just gonna walk  into a police station
and say that a doll told us  that Ashley's aunt is a monster.
No fucking way  I'm letting Catherine get away...
Show them the brain thing on the computer.
"They're cops, Rachel, they're not Google."
They're not gonna know what it means.
"-Well, there's gotta be something.  -Evidence."
I can find the evidence.
"Listen, I kept a diary on my computer.  I recorded the conversations."
"If I can make it into the house,  get in range of my laptop,"
I can Bluetooth onto it  and download all the evidence I need.
"-can you guys take me over there?  -Yes, Of course, anything."
"Hey, we don't even know where she lives."
"10030 Bushwick Drive, Malibu."
-That's miles away.  -We'll take you.
"No, we will not."
Jack.
"Sure, I get it,  you guys got something better to do."
"Well, OK, don't sweat it,  I'll just go on my own, I'm fine."
-Oh! [gasps]  -[Ashley Too groans]
Stupid stumpy arms.
-Get off me!  -Sorry.
"If you're not helping me,  get off of me, seriously."
[grunts]
[sighs]
It's alright for you two able-bodied  assholes sitting around.
"Fans are always the same.  ""Oh, we love you so much,"""
until you actually want them  to do anything for you.
"Well, forget it,  I'm gonna do it on my own."
Could you open the door for me please?
We're not helping her.
We are not.
"[Ashley Too clears throat] Guys.  Come on, guys, I can't see."
"Put me up on the dash,  I can show you the way."
Don't scratch the cup holder.  Dad will flip if he knows we took his van.
I'm not scratching the cup holder.
[horn honks]
[tires screech]
Jack! [whimpers]
"Relax, your cup holder's fine."
-Shut up.  -can you drive this thing?
-I think so.  -you think so?
"Hey, I can do anything  if I just believe in myself."
I wanna believe that  we'll arrive in one fucking piece.
"Ashley, go to sleep."
"Yeah, that's not gonna work anymore, OK?"
Shit.
"Ladies and gentlemen,  thank you for joining us today"
"as we introduce you to a brand-new,  yet strangely familiar, superstar."
It's a fucking sign-up.
"[sighs] OK, we're here."
[Rachel] So now what?
-I guess we Just throw her over the gate.  -are you nuts? how do I Get in the door?
"No, the deal was that we drive you here,  and we've done that."
I need to get inside to get that evidence.
-[Jack] We're not driving in there...  -We have brought her this far.
"-No.  -Hold up, that's my aunt's car."
"Oh, the gates are open."
"-Jack, Jack, let's go, come on.  -No, no."
"Quick, quick, they're gonna shut it."
"-Come on, let's go.  -Just do it, OK, do it, go."
"Do it, do it, do it, go, yes.  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
"Oh, my God, oh, my God.  Oh, shit, shit."
[both scream]
"[Jack] Well, what now?"
What's the next phase  of your brilliant plan?
[doorbell rings]
-What the hell do I even say?  -[Ashley Too] Just wing it.
"And lose the nose ring,  it makes you look unprofessional."
"[Jack] Oh, my God, he's huge."
Goggin's Mouse Service.
How did you get through the gate?
It was open.
"Look, I have an appointment for 11:30  to deal with your rodent infestation."
"No, you got the wrong place."
"It was 10030 Bushwick Drive, right?"
"Look, we don't have a rodent problem."
The lady of the house said  it was super urgent.
We don't have another appointment  for about three weeks.
[exhales]
"-Make It quick.  -OK, thanks."
"Oh, hey, would it be alright  if my little sister tagged along?"
Hi.
Your sister?
"Well, well, what do we have here?"
A kitchen.
"Yes, and mice love kitchens."
Have you ever seen Tom and Jerry?
It's a whole lot more accurate  than people would think.
"-Excuse me, sir, may I use the bathroom?  -[Bear] I'll take you there."
You can't just walk around.
"Actually,  I'm gonna need your help in here, mister."
"Bear, they call me Bear."
"Well, I'm gonna need your help in here,  Mr. Bear."
-What for?  -Observation.
"Uh, I really need to go."
"-Down the hall, turn left.  -[Rachel] Thank you."
"Excuse me, sir."
Has this bread box been certified?
Certified how?
"The state requires them to be certified  because the crumbs, they attract rodents."
I've never heard of that.
"Well, they forgot to tell people."
"OK, just a few more steps.  We're nearly there."
[monitor beeps]
"Oh, God."
"-It's really her.  -Oh, yeah, yeah, OK."
Quit fangirling and put me down.
I'm gonna roll over and Bluetooth in.
"You gotta keep watch on the stairs, OK?"
"Yep, you're definitely gonna  wanna take a look down here."
"There's, uh..."
clear signs of mouse activity.
[Bear] I don't see anything.
[Jack] Mm-hmm.
"[Ashley Too] Oh, boy."
[exhales]
[strains]
[prolonged monitor beep]
-What did you do?  -I did What I had to.
[alert sounds]
[Munk] The fuck is that?
[Munk] Bear.
-Yeah?  -[Munk] Check on Ashley.
"We've got some kind of power issue,  I'm not sure what it is."
OK. I'll check it out.
-Wait.  -What?
-[electrical crackling]  -[thud]
[Jack whimpers]
"Dad, please tell me  you turned down the voltage."
[Rachel cries]
You killed her.
"Rachel, listen, I know me, OK?"
And I know I wouldn't wanna exist  even ten minutes in that state.
[Jack] What happened?
She killed her.
"Look, it's not that big of a deal, OK?"
"I'm still alive, OK, I count,  I'm still me."
"You were never gonna look for evidence,  were you?"
You just come in here  and you pull the plug.
"If I'd told you that,  you wouldn't have helped me."
"No, no, we wouldn't have."
Rachel.
-We gotta go.  -I'm so sorry.
[gasps]
"Oh, shit."
-[whirring]  -[Jack] Holy fuck.
[Ashley O grunts]
-[Rachel] Ashley.  -[grunts]
"Oh, my gosh. I'm such a huge fan."
[Munk] Bear?
"[Jack] Oh, my God.  There's someone coming. Come on!"
Bear?
Bear?
[shivers]
[unsteady breathing]
[indistinct chatter]
"[Catherine] And then it's  ""It isn't a dream,"
"it's reality, but enough from me,""  yadda, yadda, yadda, then it's..."
And then it's showtime.
[phone rings]
Munk. [whispers] I got it.
Why are you interrupting me?
-[unsteady breathing]  -[Munk] She's up.
"-Who's up?  -[Munk] Sleeping Beauty, she's awake."
[Catherine] What?  What the hell is going on?
[Munk] Looks like the dream box  had a power outage.
The good news is  the restraint system works.
No.
"We need her alive,  at least until they sign the papers."
Put her back under.
Of course.
"[sobs] Please, I'm begging you,"
"please don't do this to me, please."
[grunts]
-Fuck! [sobs]  -[Munk] Shhh.
"-Please, no, no.  -It's OK."
Please.
[whimpers]
Leave her alone.
[shouts] Leave her alone. [groans]
[Munk grunts]
[groans]
[sobs] Help me.
[Ashley O] Get these things off me.
It's not opening.
[Rachel] It's too strong.
Stop moving.
"Uh, geniuses,  there's a release button under here."
-What?  -[Ashley O whimpers]
-[whirring]  -[pants]
"[Jack] OK, come on."
"[Rachel] Come on, come on. Here we go."
Who are you guys?
"I'm Rachel  and like I said, I'm a huge fan."
"[Ashley Too] Listen, lover girls,  we gotta move."
Why is that thing talking like that?  All real?
"They broke the limiter, so I am you.   Your whole brain. I'm all of you."
I can't believe there's two of you.
That thing isn't all of me.
I'm all of me.
"Really? Senior high, I had, like,  a major crush on Ryan Simmonds,"
"but he was just not interested,"
"so I made out with his brother, Stevie,  even though his braces scratched my teeth."
"-Actually, Stevie was the first guy--  -you have to Shut up."
"Also, I'm not allergic to shellfish  and I hate my Aunt Catherine."
"Aunt Catherine, oh, my God,  we have to stop her."
Stop her from doing what?
[indistinct chatter]
Are you ready?
"[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,  Catherine Ortiz."

"You'll be fine. Come on, let's go."
Get in. Come on.
[tires screech]
Fuck.
"I don't need to tell you that  in an age of streaming content,"
live tours are now by far
the most lucrative aspect  of the music industry.
"But for the past six months,  Ashley, of course,"
has been sadly unable to participate...
until today.
"Ladies and gentlemen,  we are proud to introduce you"
to Ashley Eternal.
[audience cheers]
-Isn't she great?  -[intermittent whooping]
Ashley Eternal is the most accurate
and versatile holographic performer  in history.
"Photo-realistic and fully controllable,"
right down to instant costume changes.
[murmuring]
[all gasp]
"-Oh, my God.  -Jack, do you know the way to the stadium?"
-No.  -I do.
They do.
"Wait, that's not all."
Ashley is also fully scalable.
"And when I say, ""scalable,""  I mean scalable."
[audience exclaims]
[Catherine] No more squinting  from half a mile away.
"Now the entire audience  gets a front row seat,"
no matter how big the venue.
"Finally,"
"an act that will make the live audience  put down their damn phones,"
"look up, and gasp in awe."
-You have to jump the light.  -I'm not jumping a red.
-go.  -No. OK.
[horn honks]
"I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
[siren sounds]
"-Shit, it's the cops.  -I'm never gonna get my license."
And there's more.
Ashley Eternal is streamable.
She can appear in thousands of locations  simultaneously.
"Imagine an entire nationwide tour,  all taking place on the same night."
"Never exhausted, never sick,"
"always pitch perfect, bringing her A-game."
"It's not a dream, it's reality."
But that's enough from me.
Let's give it up for Ashley Eternal.
[cheering]
See me dancing on the stage  That I've built
Spotlight on me shining strong
Feel such happiness inside of my heart
- And it's all right here   -Give it up.
Right here in my song  See my crew dancing around me
Hear the audience's screams
-[siren wails]  - Feel like I could jump
Right to the sky
And just lose myself
Lose myself inside a dream
"-Right up there, see.  -Well, how do I Get in?"
"-[both Ashleys] There's a door round back.  -OK, one at a time, please."
I've played this place a million times.
"-Me, too.  -What'd you think about the acoustics?"
"-Man, they suck.   -Right?"
"-guys, do I Just drive through?  -Uh-huh."
This is so cool.
Lose myself inside a dream
[cheering]
