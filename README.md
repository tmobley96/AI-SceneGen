# SCRIPT: Screenplay Creation for Revolutionary Intelligent Plot Technologies
![LLMMovie](https://github.com/tmobley96/AI-SceneGen/assets/124856260/1ca77dfc-6448-4e77-8733-949236fbcf61)

As we stand on the brink of a new era in storytelling, this research delves into the uncharted territory of using advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) to sculpt the intricate narratives of the Black Mirror series, demonstrating the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in redefining the art of screenplay writing. In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, the potential of language models in creative writing remains a burgeoning area of exploration. This study draws inspiration from Dr. Connie Hsueh's "A Language Model for Romance Movie Screenplays," published on January 13th, 2021, and the innovative approach of "Sunspring", a 2016 sci-fi movie scripted by an LSTM neural network. While these pioneering works laid a foundation, significant advancements in AI since then have opened new avenues for research, especially in the realm of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT).

This project blends AI and creative writing to generate Tech Dystopian scripts in the style of "Black Mirror," using dialogues from the series for data. It employs PEFT and LoRA for efficient model fine-tuning and also tests a custom GPT model built with OpenAI's GPT Builder. The goal is to create AI-generated content that closely resembles the show, showcasing AI's potential in creative storytelling and model adaptation for specific narrative styles.
